<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Actual Office and Staffing Information -- Forms E-0 &amp; E-1</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section contains instructions on updating actual office and staffing information. All recipients of 2011 LSC funding must complete these forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programs which submitted office and staffing information last year will find these forms pre-filled with last year's information and need only to update that information. Programs who did not submit office and staffing information last year will need to enter a complete set of staffing and office information. Programs that merged in the prior year will find all the surviving program's offices and staffing information pre-filled and we will also, where possible, pre-fill the non-surviving program(s) offices and their staff, renumbering them with numbers larger than the highest number used by the surviving program and redesignating their former main office as a branch. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Form E-1(a), b, c: Actual Staffing -- Workforce Analysis</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The office and staffing information for actual 2011 is organized by office (i.e. Main, Branch, Subrecipient office). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The staffing information should include all staff during calendar year 2011, including those whose salaries are/were paid in whole or in part with non-LSC funds, or whose employment with the Recipient or subrecipient terminated during 2011. Please also include in-house volunteers </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">but not pro bono attorneys</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> participating in the Recipient's PAI Program. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please report staff information for calendar year 2011 ending December 31, 2011 only and do NOT report hirings or terminations in January, February 2012. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The job codes are displayed on the screen itself. <a href="https://grants.lsc.gov/EasyGrants_Web_LSC/Implementation/Modules/GAR/Definitions/JobClassificationCodesDefinitions.html" target="_blank" class="weblink">If you need further descriptions on the Job classification codes, click here</a>. Please note that, unless you have Co-Directors, only one employee should be listed under Job Title 1, Executive Director for any one time period (if you have a change in Executive Director during the year, of course both are listed in that Job Code). If you have heads of component programs who hold the title Program Director or Executive Director within your program, they should be listed under Job Code 3 Deputy Director, since that is the most nearly descriptive Job Code and since LSC wants only one Executive Director listed for each program at any one time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Guidance on Years of Experience:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Years Exp on this Job</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this column you should report the employee’s years of experience in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">current job with this grantee</span>. Thus prior experience in the same job with a different grantee <span style="font-weight: bold;">should not</span> be included. If an employee held the same job with a grantee that was merged with this grantee, the prior experience should be counted. If an employee held the same job with the same entity before that entity became an LSC grantee, experience before the entity became an LSC grantee <span style="font-weight: bold;">should not</span> be included. Determination of current job should be by Job Code (but if an employee’s Job Code changed because of LSC changes, such as the creation of Job Code 14, then experience in a prior Job Code that was substantively the same should be included).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Years Exp with LSC Grantee</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this column you should report all years of experience the employee had with this grantee <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> with any other LSC grantee in <span style="font-weight: bold;">any job.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Years Exp in Profession</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this column you should report years of experience with any organization (or self-employed) in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">general professional area of your current job</span>. Thus, for example, if an employee is in an attorney job and was an attorney for 15 years and a paralegal for 5 years before that, the years in profession should be 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding a New Staff Person</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you add any new staff person, please check carefully to make sure they are not already listed elsewhere (such as in another office)! To add a new staff person, click the "Add New Staff" button. You will then access a screen with several fields for information about the staff member. Some of the fields, such as the staff person's name and years of experience, allow you to enter information directly into the field. Other fields, such as ethnic code, language code, and job classification code, contain a Drop-Down box which allows you to select a code for the staff person. Please enter the first name and middle initial in the 'First Name' field. Enter last name in the 'Last Name' field. Also complete the service area information as explained above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updating Staff Information</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your program provided staffing information in previous years all the staff members information will be displayed as reported. If your program did not provide staffing information last year, the screen will state that there is no staffing data available for that office and you will need to add information on staff members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To update particular staff member information please click on the name of the staff and the complete data for that staff member will be displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please update salary for existing staff persons (years of experience are already updated, so all you need to do is check if these fields are right) . Please note that there is a single salary field for LSC and non-LSC salary combined. The annual salary of a staff member should be the annualized full time salary even though the staff member worked less than full time. For example, the salary of a staff member hired July 1st with annual salary level of $40,000 will be reported in full although the actual gross amount the staff member received for the six months service was only $20,000. Similarly, if a staff member is hired part-time, the salary recorded should be what that staff member would have made on a full-time basis. For example, if a staff member works a 20-hour week (40 hours being full-time) and receives an actual gross salary of $20,000 during the year; that staff member's salary should be recorded at $40,000. Please note that we have placed a limit of $250,000 for the highest salary that can be recorded; any entry exceeding this amount will be rejected by the computer program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make the necessary changes for persons who have changed Job Codes. For persons who have ended their employment, please enter the date on which they ceased to be an employee. Please also enter information on LSC service areas as explained below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure to press the save button and verify the changes in the staffing form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Method of Reporting Full-time/part-time status</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Regular Full-Time Work Week (Number of Hours) in Form E-0 will usually be 40, but if your normal work week is less than 40 hours, you can enter your actual normal work week. Normal work week CANNOT be over 40 hours, even if most of your staff are FLSA Exempt employees who actually do work more than 40 hours! This Regular Full-Time work week is the number of hours your hourly (non-exempt) staff is expected to work in order to earn a full paycheck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then in the staff detail data entry screen for Form E-1a or E-1b (Staffing, Main Office or Staffing Branch Office), you will be asked to enter “hours per work week” for that staff member. The “hours per work week” should be the number of hours that person is scheduled to work (overtime is excluded for non-exempt staff) and time above the normal work week is excluded for exempt staff). If a staff person terminates part way through the year, this does not affect the “hours per work week”, nor is it affected if the staff member goes on leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Area Information</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual staffing forms ask for information on LSC service areas. Programs which receive funding for more than one service area will need to indicate the percentages of time which each staff member spends on activity related to each service area. These percentages should add up to 100 for staff who spend all of their time in LSC-eligible activities. For staff that does not spend all of their time in LSC-eligible activities, these percentages should add up to less than 100.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transferring/Reassigning a Staff Person</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To transfer/reassign a staff member to a different office, you need to open the staffing form of the office where the staff used to be then click on the name of the staff. The complete data for that staff will be displayed. You can then press the TRANSFER button at the top of the screen. The next screen displays a drop-down box listing all the offices to enable you select the office to which you want the staff to be transferred. Choose the office and click "continue" to complete the TRANSFER. If the transfer is to a NEW office (one not in last year's listing for your program), you MUST create the new office BEFORE doing the transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deleting a Staff Person</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To delete a staff member you should first open the staffing form of the office where the staff used to be and click on the name of the staff. The complete data for that staff will be displayed. You can then press the DELETE button at the end of the screen and confirm your action to complete the deletion. </p>

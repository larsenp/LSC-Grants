<p>The Form G-2: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Information Relating to Cases</span> is a new Form, designed to collect certain additional case-related totals on a per-grantee, rather than a per-service area basis. Thus, for Form G-2, you need only one total for each question, including all your activities, Basic Field-General, Migrant, Native American, and PAI for all your service areas. Totals are for closed cases only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Question 1 </span>asks for Total Number of Persons in all Households Served. This number is to be derived from the household data collected in the eligibility determination process. Whatever number of members there are in the household as of the date the case was accepted, this is the number to be recorded for the case. Programs are not required or expected to attempt to update this data based on subsequent changes in the household. LSC asks for a separate count of children (under 18) and adults. The total of all persons served will be automatically computed on the form as a sum of the Children and Adults numbers. If you have incomplete information for a case, only that information should be counted – and if you have a case with no information, you should still count one adult for that case (if it is a juvenile case, then record one child), rather than recording a zero for that case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Question 2</span> asks for the Total Number of Cases Involving Domestic Violence. The information requested is a total for each grantee of all cases “involving” Domestic Violence. A case “involves” Domestic Violence if the Domestic Violence is in any way a part of the case, even if peripheral, and any such case should be counted. However, if a client was subjected to Domestic Violence, but the Domestic Violence is not an issue at all in the client’s case, then that case is not counted on this form. Again, LSC is asking for one total number for each grantee, combining all clients whose cases involve Domestic Violence, irrespective of Service Area and irrespective of whether the case is PAI or staff. This should be actual numbers, with no estimates or guesses, so any cases for which you do not have the information should not be counted, even though you may be certain you have more cases “involving” Domestic Violence than you are reporting (however, all cases closed under Case Type 37, Domestic Abuse, should automatically be reported in the response to this question, even if you have no other entry in the case file concerning Domestic Violence).</p>

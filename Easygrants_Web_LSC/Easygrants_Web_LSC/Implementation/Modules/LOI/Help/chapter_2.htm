<p>Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold;">LSC Grants</span>. This application was created to make it possible to submit grant application materials to LSC via the Internet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LSC Notice of Intent to Compete and Grant applications consist of several connected pages. At the bottom of all pages are buttons which allow you navigate to either the next or previous page. You can also use the links on the left to navigate through the sections of your application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most pages have fields that you need to fill out. Some fields will already have information in them, such as a zero. Delete any information which appears in the field before entering information of your own, then you can enter new information into the field. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To go to the next field, press the tab key or move your mouse pointer to that field. Once you have filled in all the fields, go to the bottom of the page where there are buttons for saving or navigating to the next or previous page. Exiting a form does not automatically save it. If there is a save button in the page you are using, be sure to click on the save button before exiting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have completed an application, you submit it by clicking on the Submit button. Once your application has been submitted, you cannot edit &nbsp;it without first contacting LSC staff to un-submit it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:competition@lsc.gov" class="weblink">competition@lsc.gov</a>. &nbsp;We have built this site to serve you. We welcome your comments and suggestions. This site is optimized to work with Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher.</p>

Dear Executive Director,&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The purpose of this letter is to introduce a new initiative at
Legal Services Corporation (LSC).&nbsp; The Office of Program Performance (OPP) has
initiated an information management project.&nbsp; The project will gather information
about model and innovative legal services management and delivery approaches to afford
greater access to the client community.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We
will place useful information on the LSC website so that programs can implement and
replicate promising models.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Initially, the website will focus on three
topics - Intake, Pro Se, and Legal Work Supervision.&nbsp; OPP is currently gathering
&quot;best practices&quot; and models within these areas.&nbsp; We are looking at proven
techniques and innovative projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
website will also allow users to link to and reference worthy sources of material that
already exist.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Others are already at work on
similar efforts.&nbsp; We do not intend to duplicate work that is already being done well.
&nbsp;&nbsp; We will coordinate with other entities to the fullest extent possible.
&nbsp; As a funder, we want to encourage national dialogue on finding and sharing the most
effective approaches.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The information we
assemble and share can assist programs and state planning partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This project is in support of LSC's goals.
&nbsp; Strategic Directions 2000-2005, adopted by the LSC Board of Directors January 28,
2000 establishes two strategic goals:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>by
2004, LSC will dramatically increase provision of legal services to eligible persons; and
also by 2004, LSC will ensure that eligible clients are receiving appropriate<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>high-quality legal assistance.&nbsp; Promoting
synergy and encouraging the cross-fertilization of good ideas is an important step to
increase access and ensure appropriate high-quality legal assistance. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We need your support.&nbsp; We would
appreciate hearing from you about programs, procedures and techniques you are using that
you deem to be particularly effective.&nbsp; The information we are collecting is not
limited to our initial three topic areas.&nbsp; We want to look at any proven techniques
that programs are implementing.&nbsp; If you have written articles on areas that may be of
use to others, please feel free to forward them as well.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">You may forward information to Monica
Holman of OPP, who is spearheading this effort.&nbsp; She may be reached at 202-336-8850
or <a href="mailto:holmanm@lsc.gov"> holmanm@lsc.gov</a>. &nbsp; In addition, we welcome any suggestions you may have about the
project's structure.<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this project.</p>

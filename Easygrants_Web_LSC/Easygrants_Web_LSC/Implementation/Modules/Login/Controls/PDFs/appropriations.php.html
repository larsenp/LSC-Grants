<p class="italic" ><b><u>Legal Services Corporation</u></b><br /><b>Payment To The Legal Services Corporation</b></p></center>
<p class="italic" >The conference agreement provides $278,000,000 for the Legal Services Corporation, as proposed by the House, instead of $300,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, the conference agreement does not include $9,000,000 in additional contingent appropriations, as proposed by the Senate under title IV of the Senate bill. </p>
<p class="italic" >Within the total amounts provided, the conferees agree that the funds should be distributed as follows: (1) $269,400,000 for basic field programs and required independent audits carried out in accordance with section 509; (2) $1,500,000 for the Office of Inspector General; and (3) $7,100,000 for management and administration. The conferees are aware that the Legal Services Corporation has recently identified $400,000 in prior year carryover funds. The conferees expect the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate to be notified prior to any further expenditure of these funds in accordance with section 605 of this Act. The conference agreement does not include language, proposed by the Senate, for payment of attorneys fees for a specific civil action. </p>
<p class="italic" >The Legal Services Corporation historically has distributed funding for basic field programs (for all eligible clients) on an equal figure per poor person based on the 1990 census, with an exception that adjusts the formula for certain isolated states and territories. The conferees are encouraged that the Corporation has worked expeditiously to distribute funding on a competitive award basis, and urge the Corporation to continue implementation of the system that has been developed to continue providing grants to all eligible populations.</p>
<center>
<p class="italic" ><b>Administrative Provisions--Legal Services Corporation</b></p></center>
<p class="italic" >The conference agreement includes language proposed by the Senate under section 504 to provide an exception to the prohibition contained therein that would permit recipients of LSC grants to use funds derived from non-Federal sources to comment on public rulemakings or to respond to a written request for information or testimony from a governmental body, so long as the response is made only to the parties that make the request and the recipient does not arrange for the request to be made. The House bill contained no similar exception to the prohibition contained in the bill. </p>
<p class="italic" >The conference agreement corrects a code citation in section 504(a)(10)(c), as proposed in the Senate bill. The House bill contained the code citation provided in the conference report on H.R. 2076. </p>
<p class="italic" >The conference agreement includes language under section 508 to allow for the collection of attorneys fees for cases or matters pending prior to enactment of this Act. This provision does not allow the collection of attorneys fees for any new or additional claim or matter not initiated prior to enactment of this Act. Neither the House nor Senate bill contained a provision on this matter. </p>
<p class="italic" >The conference agreement makes a modification to language included in section 508 in both the House and Senate bills to provide for a limited transition time for LSC grantees to dispose of pending cases and matters initiated prior to enactment of this Act, which would now be prohibited under this Act. The agreement provides LSC grantees until August 1, 1996 to dispose of all such cases. </p>
<p class="italic" >The conference agreement contains modifications to language in section 509 proposed by the Senate related to the procedures by which LSC grantees are audited and the manner in which recipients contract with licensed independent certified public accountants for financial and compliance audits. Also included are modifications to language proposed by the Senate to clarify that only the Office of the Inspector General shall have oversight responsibility to ensure the quality and integrity of the financial and compliance audit process. Language is also included, as proposed by the Senate, to clarify the Corporation management's duties and responsibilities to resolve deficiencies and non-compliance reported by the Office of the Inspector General. Further, language is included, as proposed by the Senate, authorizing the Office of the Inspector General to conduct additional on-site monitoring, audits, and inspections necessary for programmatic, financial and compliance oversight. The House bill contained the provisions included in the conference report on H.R. 2076. </p>

However, given concerns regarding access to the legal system for victims of domestic violence, the conferees have included this provision to provide greater clarity regarding this matter.

<p class="italic" >The Committee recommendation provides $141,000,000 for the Legal Services Corporation (the Corporation) for fiscal year 2001. This amount is a decrease of $199,000,000 below the request, and $164,000,000 below the amount provided in fiscal year 2000. This amount includes: (1) $134,575,000 for grants to basic field programs; (2) $5,300,000 for Corporation management and administration; and (3) $1,125,000 for the Office of the Inspector General.

<p class="italic" >The Committee is pleased with the efforts of the Corporation to improve the case reporting of its grantees. However, the Committee feels the Corporation can continue to work with its grantees to improve case reporting and lower the grantees' reporting error rate. The Committee is also interested in the efforts the Corporation has made in developing new performance measures that will allow both Congress and the Corporation to better evaluate the work of the grantees. These efforts include developing a `cost-per-case' model and providing data on the level of non-case services provided such as community education, and services provided through self-help forms, kiosks or the internet. The Committee expects to be kept informed on the development of these measures. </p>
<p class="italic" ><u>The Committee also reminds the Corporation that its grantees are prohibited by section 504(a)(7) of P.L. 105-119 from participating in class action suits and directs the Corporation to ensure its grantees comply.</u></p>

With this in mind, the Committee recommends a less indulgent approach in these areas.</u> Furthermore, from available funds, the Committee recommends five additional investigators for the Compliance and Enforcement Division to investigate field grantees' compliance with the limited regulations grantees agreed to abide by when accepting Federal taxpayer funding.</p>

<p>For payment to the Legal Services Corporation to carry out the purposes of the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974, as amended, $329,300,000, of which $310,000,000 is for basic field programs and required independent audits; $2,500,000 is for the Office of Inspector General, of which such amounts as may be necessary may be used to conduct additional audits of recipients; [[Page 115 STAT. 795]] $12,400,000 is for management and administration; and $4,400,000 is for client self-help and information technology.</p>

<p class="italic" >The Committee recommendation includes $329,300,000 for the Legal Services Corporation for fiscal year 2002. This amount is the same as the request and $26,000 above the current year appropriation. This amount includes: (1) $310,000,000 for grants to basic field programs; (2) $2,500,000 for the Office of Inspector General; (3) $12,400,000 for Corporation management and administration; and (4) $4,400,000 for client self-help and information technology. The Committee notes that $40,000,000 is provided for civil legal assistance under the Violence Against Women Act program funded under Title I of this bill.</p>
<p class="italic" >The Legal Services Corporation is a private, nonprofit corporation that provides low-income individuals with access to legal assistance and information concerning civil legal problems. Created in 1974, the Legal Services Corporation is charged by Congress to provide assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to afford adequate legal counsel.</p>
<p class="italic" >The Committee supports LSC's efforts to streamline its service area configurations through the State planning process. However, the Committee has been made aware of concerns that LSC has attempted to impose its own reconfiguration plans on certain States without clearly articulating standards for such decisions. In several instances the Corporation rejected reconfiguration plans developed and approved by all relevant stakeholders within a State, and provided no opportunity for the State to appeal that decision. The Committee expects LSC to review the State planning process and the concerns raised, and report back to the Committee by no later than September 4, 2001, with a proposal that articulates the reconfiguration standards and process for States to appeal LSC's decisions. The Committee intends that LSC consult with appropriate stakeholders in developing this proposal.</p>
<p class="italic" >The Committee reminds the Legal Services Corporation that its grantees are prohibited by section 504(a)(7) of Public Law 105 119 from participating in class action lawsuits and directs the Corporation to ensure its grantees comply.</p>
<p class="italic" align="center" ><b>Administrative Provision--Legal Services Corporation</b></p>
<p class="italic" >The Committee recommendation includes bill language to continue statutory requirements and restrictions contained in previous Appropriations Acts, as requested.

 <p class="italic" >The conference agreement provides $278,000,000 for the Legal Services Corporation, as proposed by the House, instead of $300,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition, the conference agreement does not include $9,000,000 in additional contingent appropriations, as proposed by the Senate under title IV of the Senate bill. </p>
 <p class="italic" >Within the total amounts provided, the conferees agree that the funds should be distributed as follows: (1) $269,400,000 for basic field programs and required independent audits carried out in accordance with section 509; (2) $1,500,000 for the Office of Inspector General; and (3) $7,100,000 for management and administration. The conferees are aware that the Legal Services Corporation has recently identified $400,000 in prior year carryover funds. The conferees expect the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate to be notified prior to any further expenditure of these funds in accordance with section 605 of this Act. The conference agreement does not include language, proposed by the Senate, for payment of attorneys fees for a specific civil action. </p>
 <p class="italic" >The Legal Services Corporation historically has distributed funding for basic field programs (for all eligible clients) on an equal figure per poor person based on the 1990 census, with an exception that adjusts the formula for certain isolated states and territories. The conferees are encouraged that the Corporation has worked expeditiously to distribute funding on a competitive award basis, and urge the Corporation to continue implementation of the system that has been developed to continue providing grants to all eligible populations.</p>

The House bill contained no similar exception to the prohibition contained in the bill. </p>
 <p class="italic" >The conference agreement corrects a code citation in section 504(a)(10)(c), as proposed in the Senate bill. The House bill contained the code citation provided in the conference report on H.R. 2076. </p>
 <p class="italic" >The conference agreement includes language under section 508 to allow for the collection of attorneys fees for cases or matters pending prior to enactment of this Act. This provision does not allow the collection of attorneys fees for any new or additional claim or matter not initiated prior to enactment of this Act. Neither the House nor Senate bill contained a provision on this matter. </p>
 <p class="italic" >The conference agreement makes a modification to language included in section 508 in both the House and Senate bills to provide for a limited transition time for LSC grantees to dispose of pending cases and matters initiated prior to enactment of this Act, which would now be prohibited under this Act.

 <p class="italic" >The conference agreement contains modifications to language in section 509 proposed by the Senate related to the procedures by which LSC grantees are audited and the manner in which recipients contract with licensed independent certified public accountants for financial and compliance audits. Also included are modifications to language proposed by the Senate to clarify that only the Office of the Inspector General shall have oversight responsibility to ensure the quality and integrity of the financial and compliance audit process. Language is also included, as proposed by the Senate, to clarify the Corporation management's duties and responsibilities to resolve deficiencies and non-compliance reported by the Office of the Inspector General. Further, language is included, as proposed by the Senate, authorizing the Office of the Inspector General to conduct additional on-site monitoring, audits, and inspections necessary for programmatic, financial and compliance oversight.

The agreement also includes $5,000,000 to provide technology grants to Legal Services Corporation grantees to be used to improve pro se clinic methods and acquire computerized systems that make basic legal information and court forms accessible to pro se litigants. These grants are made with the understanding, as stated in the Legal Services Corporation budget request, that the grantees make a commitment to include in their budgets for future years amounts sufficient to maintain and upgrade their equipment.

The conferees also direct the Corporation to submit its 1999 annual case service reports and associated data reports to Congress no later than April 30, 2000. The Office of the Inspector General will assess the case service information provided by the grantees, and will report to the Committees no later than July 30, 2000, as to its accuracy, as described in the House report. The conference agreement also includes the two feasibility reports described in the House report, due no later than June 1, 2000. The conferees urge the Corporation to provide its annual case service reports by May 1 of each following fiscal year, as described in the House report. The conferees direct the Corporation to keep the Committees fully informed on its study of the issue of the statutory requirement that aliens be `present in the United States', as described in the House report.<br />

The conference agreement also includes $31,625,000 for civil legal assistance under the Violence Against Woman Act programs funded under Title I of this Act.

 <p class="italic" >The Committee recommendation provides $141,000,000 for the Legal Services Corporation (the Corporation) for fiscal year 2001. This amount is a decrease of $199,000,000 below the request, and $164,000,000 below the amount provided in fiscal year 2000. This amount includes: (1) $134,575,000 for grants to basic field programs; (2) $5,300,000 for Corporation management and administration; and (3) $1,125,000 for the Office of the Inspector General. The Committee notes that $35,250,000 is provided for civil legal assistance under the Violence Against Women Act program funded under Title I of this bill. </p>
 <p class="italic" >The Committee is pleased with the efforts of the Corporation to improve the case reporting of its grantees. However, the Committee feels the Corporation can continue to work with its grantees to improve case reporting and lower the grantees' reporting error rate. The Committee is also interested in the efforts the Corporation has made in developing new performance measures that will allow both Congress and the Corporation to better evaluate the work of the grantees. These efforts include developing a `cost-per-case' model and providing data on the level of non-case services provided such as community education, and services provided through self-help forms, kiosks or the internet. The Committee expects to be kept informed on the development of these measures. </p>
 <p class="italic" ><u>The Committee also reminds the Corporation that its grantees are prohibited by section 504(a)(7) of P.L. 105-119 from participating in class action suits and directs the Corporation to ensure its grantees comply.</u></p>

With this in mind, the Committee recommends a less indulgent approach in these areas.</u> Furthermore, from available funds, the Committee recommends five additional investigators for the Compliance and Enforcement Division to investigate field grantees' compliance with the limited regulations grantees agreed to abide by when accepting Federal taxpayer funding.</p>

 <p class="italic" >The Committee recommendation includes $329,300,000 for the Legal Services Corporation for fiscal year 2002. This amount is the same as the request and $26,000 above the current year appropriation. This amount includes: (1) $310,000,000 for grants to basic field programs; (2) $2,500,000 for the Office of Inspector General; (3) $12,400,000 for Corporation management and administration; and (4) $4,400,000 for client self-help and information technology.

 <p class="italic" >The Legal Services Corporation is a private, nonprofit corporation that provides low-income individuals with access to legal assistance and information concerning civil legal problems. Created in 1974, the Legal Services Corporation is charged by Congress to provide assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to afford adequate legal counsel.</p>
 <p class="italic" >The Committee supports LSC's efforts to streamline its service area configurations through the State planning process. However, the Committee has been made aware of concerns that LSC has attempted to impose its own reconfiguration plans on certain States without clearly articulating standards for such decisions. In several instances the Corporation rejected reconfiguration plans developed and approved by all relevant stakeholders within a State, and provided no opportunity for the State to appeal that decision. The Committee expects LSC to review the State planning process and the concerns raised, and report back to the Committee by no later than September 4, 2001, with a proposal that articulates the reconfiguration standards and process for States to appeal LSC's decisions. The Committee intends that LSC consult with appropriate stakeholders in developing this proposal.</p>

This amount is the same as the fiscal year 2004 level and $5,982,000 above the request. This amount includes: (1) $316,604,000 for grants to basic field programs and required independent audits; (2) $2,573,000 for the Office of Inspector General; (3) $13,160,000 for Corporation management and administration; and (4) $2,945,000 for client self-help and information technology.

                  <p class="italic" >The Committee notes that the Legal Services Corporation will carry forward into fiscal year 2005 balances remaining from prior year appropriations. The recommendation includes a provision to allow LSC to spend up to $1,000,000 from such balances for a law school student loan repayment pilot program in fiscal year 2005. Not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Corporation shall submit the following information to the Committee: guidelines and requirements for implementing a loan repayment program, the number of legal aid attorneys who will be able to receive student loan repayment based on the amounts made available, and the original sources of funds that will be re-allocated for a student loan repayment program. The Committee expects that this program will help to encourage more lawyers to pursue careers in legal aid.</p>

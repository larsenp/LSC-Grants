Evaluation Guidelines</strong></h3>

<hr>

<p><br>
The following are the Legal Services Corporation's Evaluation Guidelines. These Guidelines
provide insight on the range of information which LSC considers during the evaluation of
funding applications. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>We hope you find the Guidelines to be helpful in understanding the LSC evaluation
process and helpful as an additional resource on program planning, service delivery and
structure. While the Guidelines provide a helpful framework for both evaluation and
program planning, there may be other equally valid approaches that are used by providers,
which result in similar or improved outcomes for clients. The LSC proposal evaluation
process is designed to allow the consideration of all appropriate approaches. <br wp="br1">

</p>

<p>The topics of the Guidelines are organized in an order similar to the FY 1998 Request
for Proposals. Each page contains the following: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">

<ul>
  <li>Topic heading</li>
  <li>Overview statement of an effective way to address the topic </li>
  <li>Indicators of effective procedures </li>
  <li>References to source material</li>
  <li><br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    <ul type="square">
      <li>LSC Regulations <strong>(Parts 1611 and 1620)</strong></li>
      <li>LSC Performance Criteria<strong> (Criteria)</strong> </li>
      <li>ABA Standards for Providers of Civil Legal Services to the Poor <strong>(Standards)</strong>

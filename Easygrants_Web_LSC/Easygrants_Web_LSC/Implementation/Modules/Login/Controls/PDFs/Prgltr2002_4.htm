       In
        2001, LSC published <i>Draft Characteristics of a Telephone Intake,
        Advice and Referral</i> <i>System</i> and asked for comments from all
        recipients and other interested parties. The Characteristics were
        written after reviewing many documents describing standards for intake
        systems, including the ABA <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

        and Information</span></i> and the AARP <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

        we do understand that one size doesn’t fit all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We also understand that many recipients do not yet have a
        Telephone Intake, Advice and Referral System similar to that described
        by the Characteristics and that for some it may take time to put the
        Characteristics in place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LSC
        will continue to work with programs and encourage them to move forward
        on establishing the best telephone intake system possible to serve as a
        gateway to high quality, client centered legal services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The LSC Office of Program Performance will use the
        Characteristics as guidelines when evaluating the strength of grant
        applications in competition and when assessing the quality of delivery
        systems during on-site visits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
        grant applications or on-site visits reveal that a recipient is
        delivering telephone intake, advice and referral service effectively and
        efficiently to its client community in a way that is different than

        advocates to do extended services by removing the repetitive intake
        function from some of the advocates and placing it with a cadre of
        experts who are facile at determining the appropriate course for an

      the best way for certain segments of the client population to access

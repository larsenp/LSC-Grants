    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000">This memorandum
    provides general guidance for responding to the LSC Request for Proposals (RFP) for the
    provision of civil legal services. Applicants should plan to participate in the Applicant
    Informational Session. This telephonic session is designed to provide an
    understanding of the information needed to prepare the grant application. It is described
    in detail in Appendix H. Applicants may also contact LSC regarding the RFP or
    the competitive grants process. LSC is available by E-mail at </font> <a href="mailto:competition@lsc.gov"><font color="#0000FF">competition@lsc.gov</font></a> <font color="#800000"> .</font></p>

    <font SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">General Suggestions for All Applicants</font></p>
 </font><blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Consider the ABA Standards, LSC Performance Criteria, the LSC Act
        and regulations, and other materials such as LSC program letters that are included or
        referenced in the RFP. </font> </b><font color="#800000">Every application is evaluated against these sources of
        practice standards. Applicants' policies and
        practices should reflect these standards and requirements, and reflect the overall goal of
        providing high quality legal services to clients</font><b><font color="#800000">.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Consider the weight assigned to each section of the RFP narrative.</font></b>
        <font color="#800000">
        Each section of the RFP is assigned a percentage weight, which is applied during the
        review process. The weighting reflects LSC's
        evaluation priorities and should be considered in program design and implementation, as
        well as the proposal narrative.</font> <b></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Be specific rather than general.
        </font> </b><font color="#800000">Applicants should provide
        examples to support general propositions stated in the proposals. For example, in addition
        to saying that the applicant has (or is planning to have) good working relationships with
        many organizations, list the organizations and the nature of the present or
        future working relationship with each. Instead of just saying that client eligible persons were
        surveyed, state the number of persons surveyed, the number of survey respondents, how they
        were identified, and what information they were asked to supply</font><b><font color="#800000">.</font> </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Address all aspects of each RFP topic.
        </font> </b><font color="#800000">Many of the RFP
        topics ask the applicant to address several elements. For example, the question on
        coordination within the delivery system references the applicant's activities with legal services providers and with
        other community organizations that provide services to the low-income community. The
        response should thoroughly address activities with both types of organizations.</font> <b></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Organize the narrative using the 'Proposal
        Narrative Outline' (Attachment - 1 to the RFP
        Narrative Instructions) and the topic headings from the RFP instructions.
        </font> </b><font color="#800000">Responses
        should correspond to each particular section and subsection of the RFP, and should be
        labeled accordingly. Do not assume that information given in one section will be
        considered in response to another section. If necessary, either repeat information that
        you consider relevant to two sections, or cross reference your responses. For example, if
        the applicant has established a pro se clinic on domestic violence in conjunction with the
        local spouse abuse clinic, that information should be referred to in the section on
        &quot;matters&quot;
        and in the section on cooperative efforts to deliver services.</font> <b></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Make the connection between the applicant's priorities and the topic being addressed, where
        appropriate. </font> </b><font color="#800000">Legal services provider activities should evolve from a priority
        setting process. Examples of practices influenced by program priorities include: goals and
        objectives, case acceptance policies, other legal services provided, office and staffing
        configurations, and private attorney involvement. Proposals should describe the relevant
        connections that exist.</font> <b></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#800000">Address the unique aspects of each grant when applying for more than
        one service area. </font></b><font color="#800000">For example, delivery of services for a basic field -- general
        service area may differ from delivery for a basic field -- Native American or basic field
        -- migrant service area in many respects because of the different needs and priorities of
        the different communities. There may be differences in: the priority setting processes,
        priorities, goals and objectives, delivery strategies, intake systems, legal work
        management, and in other aspects of the delivery systems. Applicants are
        required to provide a separate narrative supplement when applying for
        more than one service area type.&nbsp; <a href="2003%20LSC%20RFP%20Narrative%20Instruction%20b.pdf">Click

        perceived. Check to make sure that your proposal is consistent throughout. Inconsistencies
        in the information and data presented raise questions for reviewers about the reliability
        of the information. Examples of inconsistencies from previous proposal submissions
        include: budgets that did not reflect the work described in the narrative, estimates of
        casework to be done that did not reflect the applicant's
        priorities, and staffing forms that were not consistent with the narrative description of
        staffing. A well-drafted proposal should be presented clearly and be free of spelling,
        typographical, and major grammatical errors.</font><b></p>

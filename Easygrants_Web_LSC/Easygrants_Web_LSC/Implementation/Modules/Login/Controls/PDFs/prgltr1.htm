<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Program Letter calls upon
all LSC recipients to participate in a state planning process to
examine, <em>from a statewide perspective</em>, what steps should
be taken in their states to develop further a comprehensive,
integrated statewide delivery system. State planners should
evaluate whether all programs are working in a coordinated
fashion to assure that pressing client needs are being met, that
sufficient capacities for training and information sharing exist,
that programs are moving forward together on technology, and are
collaborating to increase resources and develop new initiatives
to expand the scope and reach of their services. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In states with a number of
LSC-funded programs and/or the presence of very small programs, a
key question to be answered is whether the current structure of
the state delivery system, and specifically the number of
programs, constitutes the most effective and economical way to
meet client needs throughout the state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state planning process
should develop a report to be submitted to LSC on or before
October 1, 1998. We will be guided by your recommendations when
making our funding decisions for FY 1999 and beyond. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1995 Program Letter</strong>.
In July 1995, in anticipation of Congressional action on LSC's
1996 appropriation, we asked recipients in each state to
participate in the development of a plan for the design,
configuration and operation of LSC-funded programs in the state.
In view of potential LSC funding cuts and Congressional
restrictions on client services, we were especially concerned
that recipients work closely with other stakeholders (e.g., state
and local bar associations, IOLTA funders, the judiciary, client
groups, non-LSC-funded programs, and others with an interest in
legal services) to develop an integrated delivery system to
address client needs. A subsequent August 1995 Program Letter
outlined the issues and criteria the state planning process
should address. Included were integration of LSC-funded programs
into a statewide legal services system; advisability of
consolidation of programs; consideration of efficient intake and
provision of advice and brief service; appropriate use of
technology; engagement of pro bono attorneys; and development of
additional resources. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Responses to Changes in
Laws Affecting Clients and LSC Recipients</strong>. Much has
occurred since August 1995. Fundamental changes have been made in
laws and programs affecting eligible clients -- changes which
have increased clients' need for legal information, advice, and
representation. At the same time, LSC appropriation measures have
resulted in deep funding cuts for many programs, elimination of
LSC funding of national and state support entities, and dramatic
changes in the range of services LSC recipients are permitted to
perform. In response, many states have initiated planning
processes, developed new partnerships to leverage resources,
expanded funding sources, implemented new technologies, and
launched innovative methods for serving clients. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efforts to develop and
strengthen comprehensive delivery systems in order to improve and
expand client services continue in many states. Equal Justice
Commissions, Bar sponsored committees, and organizations of legal
services providers continue to explore ways to maximize services
in a changed and changing environment. LSC supports these ongoing
state efforts and encourages others. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1998 Grant Decisions</strong>.
In the 1998 LSC grant competition, we determined that grants in
several states that were eligible for three year funding should
be made for a shorter period. For North Carolina, grants were
made for one year. For New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Virginia, grants were made for two years. The decision to award
grants for a shorter period was made for two reasons: (1) to
encourage recipients in these states to develop further their
plans for a comprehensive, integrated statewide delivery system;
and, (2) concern that the number of LSC-funded programs in these
states may not constitute the most economical and effective
configuration for delivering legal services to the low-income
community. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1998 Program Letter</strong>.
This Program Letter calls upon all recipients to re-examine and
adjust as necessary their state delivery plans in order to
further improve and expand legal services to eligible clients
within the state. </p>

<p><strong>A Comprehensive, Integrated Statewide Delivery System</strong>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In re-evaluating delivery
plans, recipients should examine the progress they have made in
the past two and one half years in developing a comprehensive,
integrated statewide delivery system. Careful planning and
coordination is necessary to insure that pressing legal needs do
not go unmet and that resources are used wisely and economically.
States must continue to innovate and develop new strategies and
alternative delivery models to make the most of scarce resources
-- to reach more clients, and to provide higher quality services
through enhanced use of information technology; centralized
intake systems providing advice, brief services, and referrals;
expansion of community legal education, pro se, and other methods
promoting client self-help; better coordination with volunteer
private attorneys; and other, similar initiatives requiring
substantial resources and expertise to undertake. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways for states
to achieve these goals. Many excellent models exist of statewide
fundraising, integrated technology, statewide and regional
hotlines, pro se projects, taskforces and training. Recipients
should evaluate which approaches will work best in their states
to achieve an even stronger, more effective system for addressing
client needs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recipients must also examine
how the present configuration of programs, and specifically the
number of programs, impacts upon the overall effectiveness of the
state delivery system. In this regard, it is especially important
that each participant look at client services, not from the view
of just one city, or one county, or one program, but from a
statewide perspective. </p>

<p><strong>What Is Required by This Letter </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past two and one half
years, several states have undertaken extensive processes to
evaluate their delivery systems and have implemented, or are in
the process of implementing, many state planning recommendations.
Additionally, some states have ongoing planning processes
involving a wide variety of stakeholders in the civil justice
system. We do not intend such states to repeat past, or supplant
current processes. Instead, we ask recipients to either work
within ongoing processes or develop new ones appropriate to the
situation in each state. In either case, we hope recipients and
other stakeholders will view this process as an opportunity to
join together to strengthen the delivery system and improve and
expand services to clients. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this context we call upon
each LSC-funded program to share responsibility for ensuring that
a statewide planning process, whether ongoing or to be initiated,
addresses the questions discussed further below. For each
question state planners should: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>assess the strengths and weaknesses of the
            current approach; </strong></li>
        <li><strong>establish goals to strengthen and expand
            services to eligible clients; and </strong></li>
        <li><strong>determine the major steps and a timetable
            necessary to achieve those goals.</strong> </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A report should be submitted to
LSC on or before October 1, 1998.<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a>If
a state has recently developed a plan which addresses the
substance of one or more of the following questions, for those
questions, the state need only report on the pertinent section(s)
of that plan. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In exceptional cases, it may
not be possible for a state planning process to fully address all
of the following questions. In such cases, recipients should
contact the LSC staff member responsible for their state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions to be addressed are: </p>

<p><strong>1. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Intake
and the Provision of Advice and Brief Services.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>How are intake and delivery of advice and referral
    services structured within the state? What steps can be taken
    to ensure a delivery network that maximizes client access,
    efficient delivery, and high quality legal assistance?</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A successful intake system is
critical to effective and comprehensive delivery of legal
services. Over the past two years many programs have instituted
centralized telephone intake and delivery systems which provide
high quality advice and brief service assistance, and promptly
refer clients whose problems require more assistance to program
case handlers or other resources. In a number of states,
statewide or regional systems, using advanced telephone and
computer technology, have consolidated these functions in one
location where trained, experienced staff provide prompt access
for clients and minimize the risk of multiple referrals or loss
of clients. These systems improve the quantity and quality of
advice, brief service and referral assistance while increasing
the number of extended service cases which can be handled by the
program. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State planners should evaluate
the current status of intake and delivery of advice and referral
services within the state and develop strategies for improvement.
Consideration should be given to developing regional and
statewide intake and delivery systems which: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Are client-centered, providing ease of access to
            legal services and prompt, high quality assistance or
            referral; </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Use specialization to enhance case evaluation and
            provision of advice, brief service and referral
            assistance; </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Make effective use of technology; and </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide oversight and follow-up to ensure high
            quality legal services and client satisfaction. <br>
            </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Effective
Use of Technology.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Is there a state legal services technology plan? How
    can technological capacities be developed statewide to assure
    compatibility, promote efficiency, improve quality, and
    expand services to clients? </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within individual programs,
effective use of technology can reduce the cost and substantially
enhance the quality of services. Collectively, technology can
dramatically improve the capacity of staff throughout the state
to quickly exchange and share information, improving their
ability to stay current with the law, develop legal strategies,
write briefs and otherwise serve clients. In the past two years,
many programs have significantly increased their technological
capacities. On a statewide level, programs have used new
technologies to establish E-mail communication with all legal
services staff throughout the state; to connect with other
service providers; to exchange information with private attorneys
participating in PAI efforts; to establish centralized
brief/pleadings/forms/manuals/ information banks; to create
resource centers for information on state law and policy
developments; and to establish unified case management systems
which allow for data collection and outcome measures. New
technologies involving the Internet and advanced telephone and
computer applications have also been used to provide legal and
program resource information to clients.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving and staying current
with technology is costly and makes it all the more important
that states take a unified approach and develop a technology plan
that will maximize collective capacity while minimizing cost. A
state technology plan should establish reasonable goals and set
forth steps to: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Assure that all programs have networked computer
            access for all staff; integrated case management;
            computerized timekeeping; E-mail and the ability to
            electronically transfer documents; computerized
            financial management systems; and technological
            support; </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop or improve compatible technological
            capacities which will allow all staff, <em>statewide</em>,
            to communicate with each other, share information,
            and take advantage of other efficiencies made
            possible by computerization; and </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Use new technologies to provide legal and program
            resource information to clients and other interested
            persons. <br>
            &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Increased
Access to Self-Help and Prevention Information.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>What are the major barriers low-income persons face in
    gaining access to justice in the state? What efforts can be
    taken on a statewide basis to expand client access to the
    courts, provide preventive legal education and advice, and
    enhance self-help opportunities for low-income persons?</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pro se, community legal
education and access to courts efforts have great potential to
address many of the legal needs of low-income persons. Programs
in many states utilize these methods to increase legal
information available to the public, empower clients to advocate
on their own behalf, and increase access to the courts for all
low-income people. Given the intensive effort required to
implement such strategies, and the influence state laws and rules
have on such initiatives, often these results can be realized
more easily by coordinated state level efforts. In several
states, for example, collaboration with state bar committees and
state judicial administrations has resulted in rule changes,
publication of pro se oriented materials and more accessible
court systems. Likewise, the development of self-help and
community legal education materials has benefited from concerted
statewide efforts involving a variety of organizations working to
make justice more accessible. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State planners should evaluate
the status of pro se, community legal education, and access
efforts in their state and determine what steps should be taken
statewide to enhance their effectiveness in meeting client needs.
Consideration should be given to: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Statewide coordination and/or production of pro se
            and community education materials, such as brochures
            in multiple languages, videos, cable-access TV
            programs, and projects designed to take advantage of
            new technologies such as computerized pro se programs
            and the world wide web; and</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>State level initiatives, including efforts with bar
            associations, the judiciary and other interested
            parties to increase access to the courts. <br>
            &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>4. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Capacities
for Training and Access to Information and Expert Assistance. </strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Do program staff and pro bono attorneys throughout the
    state receive the training and have access to information and
    expert assistance necessary for the delivery of high quality
    legal services? How can statewide capacities be developed and
    strengthened to meet these needs? </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last two years several
states have developed new or strengthened existing capacities to
ensure that staff and pro bono attorneys throughout the state
receive necessary training and have access to information and
expert assistance essential for the delivery of high quality
legal services. These states employ a variety of methods to
provide staff and pro bono attorneys with training on substantive
law and skills development, practice manuals and related poverty
law materials, information on poverty law developments and
strategies, and co-counseling for less experienced staff and pro
bono attorneys. Communication, planning and ongoing discussion
concerning major legal needs, poverty law developments,
effectiveness of approaches, and commonalities in legal work,
helps ensure productive use of resources. The use of new
technologies has helped maximize the effectiveness of these
efforts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State planners should evaluate
current capacities for the provision of training and related
services essential for the delivery of high quality legal
services. Planners should: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Assess how a statewide approach can address the needs
            for these services of staff and pro bono attorneys
            throughout the state; and </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the steps necessary to provide these
            services as effectively and efficiently as possible. <br>
            &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>5. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Engagement
of Pro Bono Attorneys.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>What is the current status of private attorney
    involvement in the state? What statewide efforts can be
    undertaken to increase the involvement of private attorneys
    in the delivery of legal services? </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past two years, several
states have been successful in enlisting or re-enlisting the
state Bar, the judiciary and others in developing and supporting
private attorney involvement throughout the state. These efforts
have helped local private attorney involvement programs expand
participation rates and the range and types of services available
to clients. State planners should evaluate the current status of
private attorney involvement in the state and consider how
statewide strategies can increase engagement of pro bono
attorneys and benefit clients throughout the state, including
areas of the state with lower private attorney involvement. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consideration should be given
to: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Renewed efforts to involve the Bar, the judiciary and
            other leaders in the legal community in promoting
            private attorney involvement;</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing greater opportunities for attorney
            participation in a full spectrum of legal work,
            including advice and brief service, negotiation,
            administrative representation, pro se classes,
            transactional assistance, and simple and complex
            litigation; </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing greater opportunities for attorneys to
            assist programs with training, co-counseling and
            mentoring staff; and </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing greater opportunities for law schools,
            corporate counsel, government attorneys, and other
            professionals to engage in pro bono activities. <br>
            &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>6. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Development
of additional resources.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>What statewide financial resources are available for
    legal services to low-income persons within the state? How
    can these resources be preserved and expanded?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past two years, many
programs have increased the resources available to them through
innovative grant projects, local fundraising and other efforts.
Even more dramatic, however, are the increases programs have
received in many states through collective development and/or
expansion of statewide revenues such as state appropriations,
filing fee surcharges, state fundraising campaigns, state bar
dues checkoffs and direct state bar grants. Whether new or
expanded, these revenues have almost always been the product of
thoughtful planning with programs and other stakeholders working
together. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State planners should evaluate
the possibilities for further statewide resource development and
develop a statewide strategy to preserve, build, and/or create
new financial and non-financial resources in their state. Since
program efforts to build such statewide resources are more
successful when many stakeholders participate, it is especially
important for planners to involve a variety of community leaders
in these efforts. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Configuration
of a Comprehensive, Integrated Statewide Delivery System</strong>.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Where there are a number of LSC-funded programs and/or
    the presence of very small programs, how should the legal
    services programs be configured within the state to maximize
    the effective and economical delivery of high quality legal
    services to eligible clients within a comprehensive,
    integrated delivery system?</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most states, the present
delivery structure reflects national funding decisions made in
the 1970's. In many states, those decisions were not determined
by analyses of what delivery structure would yield the most
economical and effective services to clients throughout the
state. Moreover, those decisions were made before such major
developments in legal services delivery such as IOLTA funding,
private attorney involvement, law school clinical programs,
hotlines, the emergence of other civil legal aid providers, and
restrictions on recipients' non-LSC funds; and before the
information revolution and the opportunities it presents with
personal computers, E-mail, sophisticated telephone technology,
and the Internet. In light of developments over the past
twenty-five years, and especially since 1995, it is time to take
a fresh look and re-evaluate those structures. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-evaluation is particularly
critical in states with a number of LSC-funded programs and/or
the presence of very small programs. States with many programs
often suffer from uneconomical and inefficient redundancy of
effort, or no effort at all, in technology, training,
fundraising, and development of client services such as intake,
advice and referral systems or client education materials.
Similarly, small programs often lack the resources necessary to
develop proper staff supervision or appropriate specialization,
or to acquire current technology necessary for maximum
effectiveness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, while individual
programs may excel, a large number of programs or the presence of
small programs may result in unnecessary diversion of the state's
resources from client services to administrative overhead. Each
program, no matter how large or small, must devote significant
resources to A-133 audits, state and federal tax and wage
reports, funding applications, recordkeeping, personnel policies,
purchase and maintenance of technology and equipment, and other
administrative tasks. Experienced and accomplished lawyers spend
time on program administration when they could be using their
talents to represent clients, train or mentor new lawyers and
otherwise lead their program's legal work. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where these conditions exist,
state planners must consider whether consolidation of programs
would make better use of resources available in the state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no magic number of
programs or a single delivery model that fits all states. In some
states, a statewide LSC provider makes the most sense; in others,
a regional approach or other configuration may be appropriate.
Each state must examine what configuration, <em>from a statewide
perspective</em>, maximizes services and benefits for <em>clients
throughout the state</em>. Factors to be considered include: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Size, complexity, cultural and ethnic
            diversity/homogeneity of client population.</li>
        <li>Geographic, physical, and historical distinctions and

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In making grants for FY 1999
and beyond, we will look closely at each state where there is
currently a number of LSC-funded programs and/or the presence of
very small programs to assess whether careful consideration has
been given to consolidation of LSC programs. We hope, and have
faith, that in these states, this planning process will result in
plans for merger and consolidation of programs and integration of
services on a broader scale than we have previously seen, and
that each state's plan will result in a configuration that is
efficient and effective in providing access to justice for the
state's low-income clients. </p>

<p><strong>Questions </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LSC staff will be contacting
recipients to discuss this Program Letter. In the meantime, if
you have questions, please contact the LSC staff member
responsible for your state.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Program Letter is intended
to provide interpretive guidance regarding some of the most
frequently asked questions concerning the Attorneys' Fees
restriction in 45 CFR Part 1642. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1. Does the Attorneys' Fees
Restriction Apply to a Private Attorney Who Co-counsels on a Case
with an LSC Recipient?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under §1642.4(b), a private
attorney who receives compensation from an LSC recipient to
represent an eligible client in a case is subject to the
attorneys' fees restriction. Thus, a private attorney may not
claim, or collect and retain any attorneys<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">' </font>fees in the case for which
he or she is being compensated by the recipient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneys who are co-counseling
with a legal services program on a pro bono basis, however, may
seek and recover fees for the portion of the work done by them.
Part 1642 makes it clear that the attorneys<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font> fees restriction does not
apply to pro bono private attorneys. Accordingly, a private
attorney who co-counsels with an LSC recipient on a case for an
eligible client, but who does not receive any compensation from
the recipient, would not come under the restriction. LSC does not
define as compensation reimbursement for costs and expenses which
an LSC recipient may make to a pro bono private attorney, either
as co-counsel or sole counsel. <i>See</i> §1642.6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that the LSC
recipient co-counsel may not assign his or her portion of the
fees to the pro bono private co-counsel or assist the private
co-counsel in claiming what would otherwise be the LSC recipient
co-counsel's share of the fees. Henceforth, recipient co-counsel
should make clear that any claim for fees clearly notes that the
claim is being requested on behalf of the uncompensated private
co-counsel only, and that any award, order or payment of
attorneys' fees should be payable directly to the private
co-counsel. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2. Does the Restriction
Preclude a Recipient from Claiming Attorneys' Fees on Behalf of
the Client?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. LSC<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s Program Letter 96-1, dated
May 17, 1996, gave recipients general guidance about the
parameters of the restrictions pending LSC<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s process to promulgate
interim and final regulations to implement the appropriations
restrictions. In the Program Letter, we included the following
statement on the attorneys' fees restriction:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>A
    recipient may not, even for strategic purposes, include a
    claim for attorneys' fees for the recipient.<font
    face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This led some recipients to
believe that it is permissible to include a claim for attorneys'
fees in a pleading on behalf of the client. However, the final
rule does not permit claiming fees on behalf of a client. </p>

<p>Section 1642.2(d) reads:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>To claim
    attorneys' fees means to include a request for attorneys'
    fees in any pleading.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Section 1642.3 reads:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>Except as
    permitted by §1642.4, no recipient or employee of a
    recipient may claim, or collect and retain attorneys' fees in
    any case undertaken on behalf of a client of the recipient.<font
    face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two regulatory provisions
prohibit claiming any attorneys' fees, and are not limited to
claiming fees for the recipient. The language in the program
letter quoted above was intended to address the issue of whether
claims could be made for strategic reasons, and did not speak to
the issue of whether claims for fees could be made on behalf of a
client. Based on the final rule, LSC will hereafter view as
non-compliance with the attorneys' fees restriction any <font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>claim<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font> for attorneys' fees
requested by an LSC recipient, whether the claim is made for the
recipient or on behalf of the client. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>3. Does the Attorneys' Fees
Restriction Extend to Cases where Courts Award Attorneys' Fees
where None Had Been Claimed?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. The attorneys' fees
restriction applies to the<b> </b>independent acts of
&quot;claiming<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font><i>
or </i>&quot;collecting and retaining&quot; fees. Thus, even if a
recipient has not claimed fees, it may not collect and retain
them if they are awarded to compensate the attorney of the
prevailing party. Henceforth, the recipient should inform the
court that it is not permitted to accept the fee award. It is
then the court's decision as to the disposition of the fee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>4. Can a Recipient Collect
and Retain Fees from Social Security Cases Received after June
11, the Effective Date of the Final Rule on Attorneys' Fees?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the case was filed prior
to April 26, 1996, the beginning date of the Congressional
restriction,<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a>
attorneys' fees in social security cases may not be collected and
retained after the effective date of the final regulation, which
was June 11, 1997. However, because of the special nature of
Social Security fees, LSC will permit recipients to take action
to ensure that fees claimed as attorneys' fees before the final
rule became effective be given to the client. Because this type
of attorneys' fee is actually a part of the client's statutory
retroactive benefits, the recipient in this situation may request
SSA or the responsible agency to send directly to its client that
portion of the client's retroactive benefits which the recipient
had earlier claimed as attorneys' fees. If SSA has no mechanism
to accommodate the recipient's request, the recipient may <b>immediately
</b>upon receipt of the Social Security check endorse the check
over to the client. Clear documentation of this transaction
should be retained by the recipient sufficient to satisfy
auditors or Corporation monitors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>5. Can a Recipient Assign
Its Attorneys' Fees to a Third Party?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions have arisen regarding
the possibility of a recipient assigning to a third party the
fees which it has been awarded, but which it may not collect or
retain under the regulation (see sections #3 &amp; #4 above). For
all cases filed since April 26, 1996, recipients are not
permitted to assign fees to a third party. Since recipients may
not collect and retain fees in the first instance, it would
strain Congressional intent to permit recipients to do indirectly
what they cannot do directly through bypassing the restriction by
assigning their rights to collect fees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>6. Can a Recipient Claim, or
Collect and Retain Attorneys' Fees in Child Support Cases under a
Contract with the State where the State Statute Requires
Contracting Providers to seek Fees on Behalf of the State?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A question has been asked
regarding a recipient's claim of fees in child support collection
cases under a contract with a state agency. In this particular
situation, the state statute requires the contracting party (the
recipient) to seek attorneys' fees on behalf of the state to
reimburse the state for its costs to prosecute such cases.<a
href="#sup2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a> Under this
statutory scheme, recipients do not have any right to the fees.
Because we believe Congress did not intend to impose the
attorneys' fees restriction when the beneficiary of the fee award
is the State and the LSC recipient is acting under a statutory
mandate as its agent with regard to fees, the recipient's action
under the contract is permissible. Other similar situations may
not conform with Congressional intent; therefore, recipients
should seek LSC's guidance regarding whether the restriction will
apply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>7. If a Recipient Believes
that Failure to Assert a Claim for Attorneys' Fees May Jeopardize
the Client's Interest in the Case, Does 1006(b)(3) of the LSC Act</b><a
href="#sup3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a><sup><strong> </strong></sup><b>Authorize
a Recipient to Claim Fees Notwithstanding the Attorneys' Fees
Restriction? </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. LSC will find any action
claiming attorneys' fees to be violative of the restriction. In
order to comply with the restriction and to assure that recipient
attorneys can fulfill their ethical obligation in a case where
attorneys' fees can be awarded, the recipient should make a
judgment before accepting the case whether compliance with the
restriction would jeopardize the client's interest. If the
recipient believes that it would, the recipient should take
whatever action is necessary under applicable rules of
professional conduct such as disclosing to the client that the
recipient's representation will likely jeopardize the client's
interests and either declining representation or, if appropriate,
accepting the case with the client's approval.</p>

issues concerning the Attorneys' Fees restriction, please feel

<p align="center"><b>Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of
1997</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enclosed in this mailing is a
copy of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997
(&quot;Anti-Assisted Suicide Act&quot; or &quot;Act&quot;), Pub.
L. 105-12, which was enacted and became effective on April 30,
1997. The Act expressly applies to the Legal Services Corporation
and its grantees and amends Section 1007(b) of the LSC Act.
Section 9 of the Anti-Assisted Suicide Act amends Section 1007(b)
of the LSC Act by adding subparagraph (11) to paragraph (b) of
Section 1007. Section 1007(b) now provides that:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(b) No funds made available by the Corporation under this
    title, either by grant or contract, may be used -- ...(11) to
    provide legal assistance in a manner inconsistent with the
    Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 5 of the Anti-Assisted
Suicide Act (Restriction on use of Federal funds by advocacy
programs) generally prohibits the use of LSC funds for advocacy
to assist in, fund or support assisted suicide, euthanasia, or
mercy killing, or to bring suit or provide any form of legal
assistance for assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation will provide
guidance on the meaning and scope of this new restriction in the
near future. However, recipients are currently subject to this
restriction and have been since its enactment by Congress on
April 30, 1997. Recipients should become familiar with the terms
of the legislation and take any steps necessary to ensure
compliance with this new law. </p>

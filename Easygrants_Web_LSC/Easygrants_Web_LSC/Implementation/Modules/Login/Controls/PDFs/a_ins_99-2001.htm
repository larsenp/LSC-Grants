<p><b>Please submit a Notice of Intent to Compete (Form H) prior to completing Grant
Application Form A. You will not be able to access Form A unless you have previously
submitted a Notice of Intent to Compete. </b></p>

<p><b>To access Grant Application Form A, click Grant Applications on the Legal Services
Corporation Applicant Information Network homepage (<a href="http://www.ain.lsc.gov">www.ain.lsc.gov</a>).
This will take you to the Competitive Grants Applications menu. Select Grant Application
Forms. Then enter the applicant ID and Password you used to submit the Notice of Intent to
Compete. After accessing the Grant Application Forms Menu, select Form A to proceed. </b></p>

<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../images/red&amp;blueline.gif" width="587" height="7"></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Form A</b></font> </p>

<p>Form A provides summary applicant data, most of which is transferred from the Notice of
Intent to Compete Form. </p>

<p>The first screen indicates applicant name, address, contact person, applicant category,
and whether the application is a joint application or not. Please check and make sure that
all the information stated is correct. You can make changes and proceed by clicking
&#145;NEXT' at the bottom of the screen. If this is a joint application, the next screen
will ask for the joint applicant's name and category. You can edit, add and continue to
the next screen. </p>

<p>The following screen lists the service area(s) you selected in the Notice of Intent to
Compete and the estimated grant amount for each. You can delete a service area but not add
any at this point. Please click on 'NEXT' to proceed. </p>

<p>On the last screen, enter the name of the Executive Director and Board Chairperson to
complete the form. </p>

<p>After the data entry is completed, save your work and print a copy before submitting to
LSC. You can save, edit and make changes to the form as many times as you want. Once
submitted, however, you cannot access it unless you contact LSC to unsubmit it. </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program letter provides
guidance as to the timing and format of the semiannual case
disclosure report required by law as discussed in detail in 45
C.F.R. Part 1644 (63 F.R. 33251, June 18, 1998)<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a><strong>.</strong>
<strong>The semiannual reports will be due at the Corporation by
August 1 for cases filed from January 1 through June 30 of each
year and on February 1 for cases filed from July 1 through
December 31 of each year.</strong> Please direct completed
reports to Compliance and Enforcement Unit, Office of Program
Operations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reports shall be filed on
the attached form, entitled &quot;<a href="pgltr_5a.htm">Case
Information Disclosure Report&quot;,</a> or, in the alternative,
if a recipient compiles all the information requested by LSC on
its own form, submission of that form will meet the semiannual
case disclosure requirement. If a recipient submits its own form,
it must include the caption &quot;LSC Case Disclosure Semiannual
Report for [Recipient Name].&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For guidance as to which cases
must be disclosed, see §1644.3; note that §1644.3(b) provides
that disclosure of cases in which a private attorney provides
legal assistance as a part of a recipient's PAI activities is not
required. For guidance as to what information must be disclosed,
see §1644.4. If the name and address of a party is withheld
under §1644.4(a)(1)(i) or (ii), the recipient should so note in
the space provided for name and address on the attached form.
Such notation should be in the following form:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A) Withheld pursuant to 45 C.F.R. §1644.4(a)(1)(i)
    because this information is protected by [insert appropriate
    language, such as &quot;order of the court&quot;, &quot;rule
    of the court&quot;, &quot;State law (citation)&quot;, or
    &quot;Federal law (citation)&quot;]; or </p>
    <p>B) Withheld pursuant to 45 C.F.R. §1644.4(a)(1)(ii)
    because the [insert recipient name] has determined that
    disclosure of this information would put its client(s) at
    risk of physical harm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a recipient has a grant to
serve clients under legislation such as the Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) or the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), there is a
greater likelihood that disclosure would put a client at risk of
physical harm and recipients should use the exception under
§1644.4(a)(1)(ii) liberally. Such risk is not, however, a
certainty and the determination must be made case-by-case by the
attorney providing representation. For example, if the recipient
is certain that the name and address of the client is already
known to the person who poses a physical danger to the client,
the recipient could determine that disclosure is harmless. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the attorney providing
representation determines that disclosure would lead to a risk of
physical harm to a relative of the client, the recipient may
withhold the client's name and address, especially if the
relative at risk is a child. In such instances, the recipient
must keep a record of this determination and the reasons for it.
For any other situation where it is not clear whether the
risk-of-harm exception applies, the recipient should consult the
Corporation before making a decision on disclosure. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some instances, the name
and/or address of one or more parties may be unavailable to the
recipient.<a href="#sup2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a> For
example, an opposing party may be a Jane or John Doe, or a party
may be homeless, or a party's address may be a P.O. Box. In such
instances, the recipient should provide whatever information is
available and enter &quot;Not Available&quot; for the remaining
information.<a href="#sup3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a><strong>
</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For further information please
contact Danilo Cardona at (202) 336-8800.</p>

<p><a name="sup1"><sup>1</sup></a> The publication of the 45
C.F.R. Part 1644 and the issuance of this Program Letter
supersede Program Letter 97-2, which was interim guidance on the
case information disclosure requirements of Pub. L. 105-119.</p>

<p><a name="sup2"><sup>2</sup></a> When there are multiple
parties, the reporting obligation extends to all parties.
Reporting name and address of just one client or one opposing
party is not sufficient.</p>

arrangements that are not PAI, recipients may not use the fact
that this information is not in their files as an excuse not to
report on such cases. In such cases, recipients must obtain the
information from their subrecipient and may not claim
unavailability unless it is unavailable to the subrecipient.</p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-language:EN-US">This program letter
      addresses a small additional step that you can take, if you haven't
      already done so, to eliminate a significant source of remaining problems
      in CSR counting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Defaults are
      insertions of a particular value that are automatically made in a data

      for someone entering data to skip over a field that already contains data
      rather than correcting the default when it is not accurate, defaults can
      be a source of errors in the record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In this letter, we require grantees to remove defaults where they
      present the danger of presenting false information about crucial
      eligibility information, and make other suggestions about defaults. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <i><b>
      Why
      have any defaults?<o:p>
      </b></i>
      </o:p>
      <p>It is very common for
      different fields in a case management software (CMS) program to default to
      a predetermined value. There can be good reasons for this. For example,
      your office is located in Big City, and most of your clients are from Big
      City. It makes sense for the software to default to “Big City” in the
      city field so that staff do not have to type “Big City” over and over.</p>
      <p>With CMS, many fields are
      required fields. This means the record cannot be saved unless there is an
      entry in that field. Often there is a default value programmed into the
      CMS so that there is something in every required field.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">While this may be a handy device for being sure a
      record can be saved, it is not the best way to ensure the accuracy of the
      data. When you come back to the record, you do not know if staff entered
      the data, or it was simply left there from the default.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">What needs to be done is to strike a balance that
      makes the software easier to use but does not sacrifice accuracy. We have
      prepared this Program Letter to give you guidance in this process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><i><b>Fields
      where defaults are not permitted<o:p>
      </b></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The first thing we will do is to advise you which
      fields should never have a default value. Deciding which fields these are
      is very simple. If client eligibility depends upon the data in the field,
      it should never have a default. These fields are income, number in
      household, assets, and citizenship.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Why shouldn’t you have a default for these? It is
      tempting to default citizenship to Yes since most persons applying for
      service are citizens. This will save typing. The problem is that if the
      software defaults to Yes then when the records are checked for accuracy
      there is no way to know if the applicant was asked if he/she was a citizen
      or the question was skipped. In either of the cases, if there is a
      default, the answer is Yes. So the answer tells you nothing.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">However, if the default is removed so that the
      field is blank, when it is checked and found to contain “Yes”, it
      verifies that the question was asked and the answer recorded. If it had
      not been, the field would still be blank. This is just as critical for
      income, assets and number in household. These fields should be blank when
      you start an intake.</p>
      <p><i><b>Fields
      where defaults are not recommended<o:p>
      </b></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">But CMS has many more fields than these three. What
      about them? As a rule, removing defaults will increase the accuracy of the
      information. We strongly suggest you remove defaults for the following
      common fields: age, race, sex, LSC problem code, and funding source.
      Defaults for age and LSC problem code save little time because there is no
      usual answer. It can be argued that having a default for race, sex and
      funding source helps intake staff. We understand this but do not recommend
      having defaults for these fields. That said, if you continue to have
      defaults, be sure you have procedures to check the data for errors.<s> <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </s></p>
      <p><i><b>Fields
      where defaults are optional, even useful<o:p>
      </b></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">For other fields, such as city, county, and state,
      defaults are valuable and can save time. We suggest that you look at these
      other fields and decide when defaults will be useful and appropriate.</p>
      <p><i><b>How
      to remove defaults</b></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Defaults are functions of the structure of the
      database software used to build your CMS. As well as sending this Program
      Letter to you, LSC is distributing it to major vendors of CMS. These
      include Legal Files, Practice Manager, Pika, Kemp’s Case Works,
      Telelawyer, and Time. If your vendor is not listed,
      please contact Glenn Rawdon, <a href="mailto:grawdon@lsc.gov"><span style="color:windowtext">grawdon@lsc.gov</span></a>,
      and he will be sure to get them this information.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">If you have a proprietary CMS, or if your
      commercial CMS program allows the end user to make modifications to the
      software, here are some things you can do to make these modifications.
      First, be sure to back up all files associated with the database, both
      data and program files. This way you can always get back to where you were
      if something doesn’t go right with the changes.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Next, you need to identify which fields have
      defaults. To do this, open a new case record and see which fields already
      contain data. The ones that do are the ones that have defaults. Now see
      which of the fields that have data are the ones covered by this letter.
      Once you do that, you will know which field defaults need to be removed.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Data for the CMS is stored in a database table.
      Each field in the table has definitions, such as whether it is an
      alphanumeric, a date, or a number field. Typically, one of these field
      definitions is for a default. When the field for a new record is created,
      this default is displayed. To remove the defaults as outlined in this
      letter, you should start by looking at field definitions for the fields
      covered by this letter. Most software has a design view that allows you to
      look at these and change them. Start by removing any field definition
      defaults for these fields.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">If the field has a default, but you find nothing in
      the default value in the field definition, the default may be contained in
      the form that is displayed when you enter the data. (Database files may
      contain many objects, such as tables, forms, queries, reports, and
      macros.) In the database, find the form that is displayed when you enter
      client data and look at it in the design or programming mode. Go to the
      field that has the default you need to remove and look at the properties
      for that field. One of these may be for a default. If so, you should
      remove it here. Also, you need to be aware that, with many CMS programs,
      the forms reside on the workstation while the data tables reside on a
      central server. If this is how your CMS works, removing defaults for the
      form on one computer will not remove them on other computers. To do this,
      the client file on each workstation must either be changed or replaced
      with one that has been changed.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">If a field has a default and you did not find it in
      the table or in the form, it may be coming from another table. Some
      programs store default values this way. This is a good design method
      because it makes it easy for the user to change the defaults. If your CMS
      does this, it is likely you have a menu for Setup, User Settings, or
      something similar. If so, go to this function of your CMS and see if the
      default you need to remove is here. If so, delete the entry for that
      field.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Not everyone can change a CMS. This is not a job
      for the normal computer user. Hopefully you have someone on staff familiar
      with the database your program uses or can hire a consultant who is. If
      you know another legal services program that uses the same program you do,
      you might contact them and pool your efforts. The changes you need to make
      are not extensive and should not take that long. The most time consuming
      part will be updating each workstation with the new program file if that
      is required by your CMS.&nbsp;<o:p>

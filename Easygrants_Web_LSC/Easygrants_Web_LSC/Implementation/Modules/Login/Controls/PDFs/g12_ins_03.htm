<p>After you have entered your Applicant ID and password, you will access the Grant
Application Forms menu. Select the Client Services - Form G and click 'PROCEED' to continue. Then
you need to select a service area. The service area screen will contain a Drop-Down box
which contains a listing of service areas you entered in your Notice of Intent to Compete
Form. To select a service area, click on the service area identifier, then click on the
'OK' button at the bottom of the screen. </p>

<p>After you have selected a service area, you will access the Client Services Forms menu

<p><strong>For LSC to obtain accurate information from these forms, all applicants must
use consistent terms and concepts when compiling and submitting data. Refer to the
 <a href="#G_DEF"><font color="#0000FF">Client Services Definitions</font></a>  
at the end of
these instructions for necessary guidance. </strong>You can view and print the
Instructions and Definitions for your easy reference. </p>

<p>Please note that applicants which apply for more than one service area must complete a
separate set of forms for each service area. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Scrolling Forms.</b></font> Because the Client Services forms
are larger than a single screen will contain, each form has a scroll bar along the
right-hand margin of the screen to enable you to see the rest of the form. Clicking on the
scroll bar will enable you to scroll down through a form.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Entering Data</b></font> Each form has certain information
pre-filled, including your organization's name and LSC Applicant ID. Each form will
contain cells for entering client services information, such as numbers of cases. To enter
this information, click on the cell in which you want to enter information, then type in
the information. You may also use the Tab key to move to the next cell in a form. Pressing
the Shift and Tab keys simultaneously will enable you to move to the previous cell. </p>

    <p><font color="#008000"><b>Numeric Data.</b></font> Some forms require entry of numeric
information. These forms will not work properly with non-numeric data such as commas or
spaces. <b><i>Please do not enter commas or periods in numeric data, or leave a cell blank
instead of entering zero.</i></b> Entering commas, periods or any non-numeric data will
cause an error message while saving. The system will not allow you to save such data.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Saving Data.</b></font> Each form has buttons at the bottom
for Saving, Submitting, and Exiting. Please be sure to press the SAVE button prior to
exiting the form on which you have been working. <b><i>The EXIT button does not save
information which you have entered.</i></b> Pressing the SAVE button also calculates or
recalculates any totals in the form. You may press the SAVE button at any time to save
information which you have entered and recalculate totals. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Exiting Forms.</b></font> After saving the information which
you have entered, you may click on the EXIT button to leave the form on which you have
been working. You may exit from and return to any form as many times as you wish, provided
that you have not clicked on the SUBMIT button. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Printing Forms: </b></font>You can use your browser to print
the form that you are working on. Click on the print icon at the top of the screen when
you are ready to print and click on 'OK' to print. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Submitting Forms.</b></font> Once you are certain that a form
on which you have been working is complete, you may submit it to LSC by clicking on the
SUBMIT button. <b><i>Please do not press the SUBMIT button unless you are certain that you
no longer wish to work on the form.</i></b> After you have submitted a form to LSC, you
will be unable to access it without calling LSC to ask that we un-submit the form. </p>

<p><strong>Client Service</strong> includes all forms of advice, brief service and

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Limited Service </strong>includes counsel, advice, brief service, referral

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Extended Service</strong> includes negotiation toward settlement (with or
  without litigation), administrative agency proceedings, litigation in court and other
  services beyond limited service, including transactional services which do not involve a
  controversy, and thus are not &quot;settled&quot; or litigated. Examples of such
  transactional services include drafting complex wills and contracts (simple ones would be
  classified as Brief Service), obtaining licenses or permits, purchasing or selling real
  estate and obtaining small business loans.&nbsp; Thus, cases in CSR Categories F, G, H, I
  and K should be considered &quot;Extended Services.&quot;&nbsp; For further information
  about CSR categories, please refer to the LSC  <a
  href="NEWCSR.htm"><font color="#0000FF">CSR Handbook</font></a>.</p>

<p><b>Cases</b> are services in which assistance is
provided to one or more specific eligible clients. Examples include representation in
litigation, administrative proceedings and negotiations, and such actions as advice,
providing brief services and transactional assistance, and assistance with individual PAI
cases.</p>

<p><b>Matters</b> are actions that contribute to the
overall delivery of services that do not involve direct legal advice to, or legal
representation of, one or more specific clients. Examples include: special project
meetings about legal services to the community; community education events; pro se
clinics; providing information about the availability of legal assistance; developing
informational materials; training; continuing legal education; general supervision of
applicant services; the preparation and dissemination of desk manuals; PAI recruitment;
and other direct or indirect applicant services that are not actions taken in cases.</p>

<p><b>Supporting Activities </b> are actions that are
administrative in nature and are not cases or matters. Such actions include fundraising
and actions classified as &quot;management and general&quot; for accounting purposes.
Examples of supporting activities include: fundraising; board meetings; staff breaks;
general staff meeting; researching timekeeping systems; and staff evaluations.</p>

newsletter and newspaper articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
two types of matters should be treated differently in reporting for 2002
forward.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></span></p>
<p style=""><span style="color: green;"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">"Newsletters"
refers to program newsletters or other newsletters over which the program has
control of distribution and therefore can produce counts (or reliable estimates)
of the numbers of newsletters distributed.&nbsp; They
should be counted as discussed in Question 2 above.<o:p>

 &nbsp;</o:p>
</o:p></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: green;"><span style="color: green;"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">&nbsp;"Newspapers" refers to general print
media over which the program does not have control of distribution -- for
example, a community newspaper.&nbsp; Because
the program does not control distribution, it is difficult to break circulation
data (which is generally available) down into reliable counts or the number of
people in our target audience (i.e., low income people or helping
agencies that serve low income people) likely to have seen and read the legal
education articles.<o:p>
&nbsp;</o:p></font></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: green;"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">To
clarify this issue for 2002 and beyond, newspaper articles have been redefined
and a category I C has been added to Community Legal Education for reporting
them. (see the new Matters Form I C in the sample forms package posted on
the Recipient Information Network web site).&nbsp;
For 2002, it will ask for the number of articles published.&nbsp;&nbsp; We anticipate that most
will have no trouble retrospectively reporting that data for 2002, but if the
information is not available you should NOT report any numbers for newspaper
articles, but be sure to point out that you did publish newspaper articles in
the narrative portions of the matters report.<o:p>

4 — As with newspaper articles,
materials broadcast on TV and radio have been redefined and should be counted in
the Matters Form I C.&nbsp; Please count each time a video or radio spot airs as
one matter.&nbsp; In 2001, some programs
tried to estimate the audience and counted the aggregate as Matters. The data
was deemed too unreliable to be meaningful.&nbsp;
Report the actual count of each airing for 2002.&nbsp;

</span>Any additional matters in each type of matter that you have not counted
but have a reasonable basis for estimation should be estimated.<span style="">&nbsp;

(See response to Question 2 under Changes in Reporting for 2002 for further
information on counting brochures and newsletters).</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">For Section B “Subject Matter Categories” reporting,
you report one number for each subject matter category of each type of matter.<span style="">&nbsp;

First, we are no longer counting “hits”, but page “views.”<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This way, only access to the particular page is counted and it is only
counted once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our goal with the
Results Project is to allow you to report your matters without putting a large
burden on you to do it. You should work out a system to apportion and report web
site page views that works the easiest for you. There are two likely models for
a statewide web site. (1) A common page (such as a site sponsored by the bar
association) that has some materials and links to individual program sites. (2)
A common site with information about all of the programs and content supplied by
the programs, but no program has an individual site.</font></p>

narrative and is separate and not included in the 300-1000 words length of
Section A. The request is for two to five vignettes from among all your types of
Matters -- there is no expectation of completeness here and, indeed, you are not
even required to select an indirect service for&nbsp;one of these vignettes.&nbsp;
As for estimation methods, this is Section C of the narrative and is, again,

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><i><span style="">Question 1</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">—<span style=""> When an intake specialist makes a referral or mails CLE materials to a
client who has also received advice or brief service, and the CLE or referral
reiterates or supplements the advice given, do we count that CLE?<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><i><span style="">Answer 1</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">—<span style=""> For the CLE, we would interpret the mailing as part of the Counsel &amp;
Advice or Brief Service, so it should not be counted separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, we do not want programs to expend any significant effort on this
duplication issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, if it
is known at the time of entry that there is a CSR case, the CLE should not be
entered, but we do not ask you to check your matters against your CSR's to
ferret out such instances.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style=""><font face="Times New Roman, Times">For the referral, the case could have been closed under "Referred
After Legal Assessment" and if it is, the referral should not be reported
as a matter since it is included in the case closure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the referral is not a significant element of the legal assistance and
the case is closed as Counsel &amp; Advice or Brief Service (CSR Categories A or
B), then the referral may be reported separately as a matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, we do not want programs to expend any significant effort on this
duplication issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
decisions should be made at the time of entry of the matter into the records
system and we do not ask you to check your referrals against CSR's to detect any
that would duplicate "Referred After Legal Assessment" cases.<o:p>

"paper?"<o:p>

While we are not imposing duplication checking, you should avoid reporting
methods that tend to run up numbers by counting more than one matter for the
same activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, you
should count either "heads" or "paper", but not both.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><i><span style="">Question 3</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">—<span style=""> Some ULS attorneys volunteer their time to run pro se divorce clinics.
Participants are not screened for eligibility. May we count attendance at these?
If we refer an individual to such a clinic, can we count this as a referral to
"other source of assistance?" Does it matter that the referred
individual may not be financially eligible for LSC-funded assistance (even if
divorce without violence were within our case service priorities)? Obviously, if
we count both the number who attend such clinics and those referred, duplication
will exist to the extent that some people who are referred will actually attend.<o:p>

</span>It is unclear from the question whether this is a ULS activity or just
one that ULS personnel volunteer for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
it is an activity of your program, you can count the attendees as matters,
presumably under pro se. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If it is
not a ULS activity, you can count the referred individuals as referrals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You should not do both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
general, if an activity is a ULS activity, you cannot count referrals to it, but
can count it under other matter types.<o:p>

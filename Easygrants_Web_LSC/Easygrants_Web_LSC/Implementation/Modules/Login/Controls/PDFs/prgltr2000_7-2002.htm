Program Letters 98-1 and 98-6 launched LSC's most recent
state planning activities approximately three years ago. Pressured by funding
shortfalls and the changing needs of clients and concerned with enhancing system
efficiency, effectiveness and the ability to meet clients' legal needs, legal
services programs throughout the United States were challenged by these two
program letters to become actively engaged in a process of reassessing their
delivery practices and policies, restructuring their legal services delivery
systems and reallocating their legal services dollars. Essentially, LSC Program
Letters 98-1 and 98-6 asked grantees to look at their roles in a new way -- to
expand their horizons from what's best for the clients in my service area to
what is best for clients throughout the state. Using this new lens, programs
were asked to report on how they would coordinate and integrate their work in
seven important areas -- enhancing client access, efficiently delivering high
quality legal assistance; effectively using technology to expand access and
enhance services; promoting client self-help and preventive legal education and
advice; coordinating legal work and training staff; coordinating and
collaborating with the private bar; developing additional resources to support
legal services delivery; and designing a legal services delivery configuration
that enhanced client services, reduced barriers and operated efficiently and
effectively.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>On January 28, 2000, the LSC Board of Directors approved LSC’s
5-year Strategic Direction Plan.<a href="#sup1"><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF"><sup>1</sup></font></strong></a> This document commits LSC to dramatically
enhance the impact of Legal Services programs throughout the nation by improving
access to legal services among eligible persons while enhancing the quality of
the services delivered. The Plan highlighted LSC’s State Planning Initiative
as the primary strategy for expanding access to and availability of services
throughout the United States.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Over the course of the last three years, many states have
begun to develop comprehensive and integrated legal services delivery systems
that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>recognize that state justice communities must be broader than just LSC-funded
    grantees to include both LSC-funded and non-LSC funded sectors of the legal
    services delivery system, and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>provide a continuum of services that encompasses individual
    representation, extended representation, advice, pro se advocacy,
    preventative education, community involvement and support, and the use of
    technology to expand essential services to all low-income persons within a
    state.</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are exciting developments. However, it continues to be
apparent that in many states and territories, the legal services delivery system
remains a fragmented set of disconnected services. In many states we continue to
find a wide divergence in the availability of services, client access
capabilities and civil equal justice resources. This stands in stark contrast to
our expectation that the statewide delivery system be constructed and maintained
to provide for: (a) relative equity of client access to the civil legal services
delivery system throughout the state: (b) relative equity in the availability of
the full range of client service capacities necessary to meet the full continuum
of client legal needs regardless of where in the state clients live; (c)
relative equity in the capacity to serve client communities in all of their
diversity; and (d) relative equity in the investment of civil equal justice
resources (federal, state, private, and in-kind/pro bono) throughout the state.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>A hallmark of an integrated delivery system is its
flexibility to deploy resources in geographic or substantive areas so that
quality of services is improved, funds are increased and outcomes for clients
are expanded in areas where they are weak. In this context, then, relative
equity considers the system’s various capacities throughout the state, from
region to region, and directs necessary resources to locales where improvement
of any sort is required to assure that all low-income people in the state have
similar degrees of access to the full spectrum of equal justice services.
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>In this program letter we are announcing three strategies to
advance LSC's efforts to create comprehensive integrated, coordinated,
client-centered state justice communities in each state:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The creation of a team within LSC specifically assigned responsibility for
    state planning;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A period of self-evaluation by and in each state justice community, with
    an evaluation report to be issued to LSC at the end of the evaluation
    period; and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The linking of state planning with the development of new performance
    measurement tools.</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The information received from the field on the State Planning
Process and Program Letters 98-1 and 98-6 after publication of these two
documents in the Federal Register and input derived from more than two years of
on-site engagement by LSC staff and consultants in the field were instrumental
in the development of these strategies.</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="center">The Creation of a State Planning Team within LSC</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>LSC's Strategic Plan emphasizes that LSC's State Planning
Initiative is our primary strategy for expanding access to and availability of
services throughout the United States. To stress the importance of this effort
and to facilitate the development of state justice communities, LSC will create
a planning team to coordinate our state planning activities. This team will be
directly attached to and supervised by the LSC Vice-President for Programs.</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="center">A Period of Self-Evaluation by and in Each State Justice
Community</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>We are in a period of significant transition moving from an
LSC-centric legal services model to comprehensive, integrated and
client-centered state justice communities. We acknowledge that the journey is
not over and that significant effort remains to ensure that comprehensive
justice communities exist and function within every state and territory. As we
move forward with our efforts, we must remain conscious of the need to address
several questions of fundamental relevance. These include:</p>
<ol>
  <strong>
  <li>To what extent has a comprehensive, integrated client-centered legal
    services delivery system been achieved in a particular state?<br>
    <br>
  </strong></li>
  <strong>
  <li>To what extent have intended outcomes of a comprehensive, integrated and
    client-centered legal service delivery system been achieved including but
    not limited to service effectiveness/quality; efficiency; equity in terms of
    client access; greater involvement by members of the private bar in the
    legal lives of clients; and client-community empowerment?<br>
    <br>
  </strong></li>
  <strong>
  <li>Are the best organizational and human resource management configurations
    and approaches being used?</li>
</strong>
  </ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>We believe that the next several months are an appropriate
time to try to begin to answer these questions. We have been involved in state
planning activities for approximately three years, and LSC believes that states
need a period of introspection about where they have been and where they are
going. Moreover, we can all acknowledge that self-evaluation is a worthwhile and
important part of our planning for the creation of comprehensive, integrated,
client-centered legal services delivery systems within each state. We are,
accordingly, requiring our grantees and requesting that other state planners
begin a period of evaluation of their planning efforts and activities over the
last three years using the above questions as a framework for the evaluation
report. These self-evaluations will inform each state justice community and LSC
of what has worked, what has not worked and why, what obstacles stand in
planners path, and what steps and support might assist each state to better
achieve a comprehensive, integrated, client-centered delivery system that
delivers upon the promise of equal justice for all.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Evaluations can be performed by state planners themselves or
by outside consultants hired to perform this task. We ask that a single
evaluation report for each state be submitted to LSC on or before July 1, 2001
unless LSC has granted your state an extension of time in which to file the
report. Please submit your extension requests no later than May 15, 2001, to
Robert Gross, Senior Program Counsel for State Planning at LSC. Reports should
be no longer that 30 pages (not more than 10 pages single-spaced for each area
of inquiry) and should contain the name and telephone number of a contact
person(s). Attachments will be accepted as long as they provide additional
information that clarifies a particular issue or area of inquiry as identified
in the body of the report. The report should assume that the effort to create
state justice communities is ongoing and that we do not expect that you have
completed your work. Self-evaluation reports should be a candid and honest
assessment of the progress that each state has made in creating a comprehensive,
integrated and client-centered delivery system as well as of the work that
remains to be done. Reports should address the following issues in the order
presented:</font><font FACE="Tahoma"></p>
</font><font FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#800080"><strong>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To what extent has a comprehensive, integrated and
client-centered legal services delivery system been achieved in a particular
state?</strong>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas of exploration include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What are the important issues that impact upon low income people within
    your state? How is your state responding to these issues?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What are the components of the delivery system?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Has this system created mechanisms to assess its performance in
    relationship to commonly-accepted external guides such as the ABA Standards
    for Providers of Civil Legal Services to the Poor, the LSC Performance
    Criteria or some other set of objective criteria? What is the protocol for
    undertaking system performance review and when was a review last undertaken?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Does your statewide system work to ensure the availability of equitable
    legal assistance capacities to clients -- regardless of who the clients are,
    where they reside or the languages they speak? How does your system ensure
    that clients have equitable access to necessary assistance including
    self-help, legal education, advice, brief service, and representation in all
    relevant forums? Please describe what steps you anticipate taking to ensure
    equitable access in the coming years.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>How does the legal service delivery system employ technology to provide
    increased access and enhanced services to clients throughout the state? What
    technological initiatives are currently underway and how will they support
    the integrated statewide delivery system?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>How has the legal service delivery system expanded its resources to
    provide critical legal services to low income clients including hard to
    reach groups such as migrant farmworkers, Native Americans, the elderly,
    those with physical or mental disabilities, those confined to institutions,
    immigrants and the rural poor?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What steps have been implemented within the legal services delivery system
    and among client communities to identify and nurture new leaders? Do the
    existing leaders reflect the diversity within the state and within client
    communities that your delivery system serves? Do your state’s equal
    justice leaders reflect the gender, race, ethnic and economic concerns of
    important but sometimes overlooked groups within your state? Does the
    leadership provide opportunities for innovation and experimentation; does it
    support creative solutions to meet changing needs; are new ideas welcomed;
    are clients nurtured as leaders? Has the leadership been given sufficient
    authority and resources to implement needed changes?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What do you envision will be your next steps to achieve a client-centered
    integrated and comprehensive delivery system within your state or territory?
    How will clients be actively involved in the determination of these next
    steps?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What has been the greatest obstacle to achieving a statewide, integrated,
    client-centered delivery system and how was that obstacle overcome or,
    alternatively, how do you plan to overcome that obstacle?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Has any benefit-to-cost analysis been made in terms of creating a<strong>
    comprehensive, integrated and client-centered legal services delivery system
    in your state</strong>? If yes, what does your analysis show?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What resources, technical assistance and support would help you meet your

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas of exploration include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In terms of the issues impacting upon low-income persons within your
    state, what strategies have you designed to address these issues and how do
    you plan to measure your future success in addressing your objectives?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Has the legal services delivery system expanded access and services
    through coordination with providers throughout the state? Can this be

    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Has the quality of services provided by the legal services delivery system
    improved. How?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Since 1998, has there been improvement in the relative equity of client
    access throughout the state for all low income clients regardless of who
    they are, where in the state they reside, what languages they speak, their
    race/gender/ national origin, or the existence of other access barriers? How
    is this equity achieved?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Since 1998, has there been improvement in the relative equity in terms of
    the availability of the full range of civil equal justice delivery
    capacities throughout the state? What mechanisms have been developed to
    ensure such relative equity is achieved and maintained? Since 1998, has
    there been improvement in the relative equity in the development and
    distribution of civil equal justice resources throughout the state? Are
    there areas of the state that suffer from a disproportionate lack of
    resources (funding as well as in-kind/pro bono)? If so, is there a strategy
    to overcome such inequities?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Does this legal services delivery system operate efficiently? Are there
    areas of duplication?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Has the system expanded the way it involves private lawyers in the
    delivery of essential services to low-income persons? Does the system
    effectively and efficiently use the private bar to deliver essential
    services to low income people?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
  <strong>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the best organizational and human resource management
  configurations and approaches being used?</p>
  </strong>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas of exploration include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For calendar year 2001, what is the current configuration of programs (LSC
    and non-LSC) that deliver services to low income clients -- i.e., what are
    the components (size, areas of responsibility, governance) of the delivery
    system? What are the funding sources and levels for each of these components
    of the delivery system?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Since October 1998, what other configurations and/or approaches have been
    seriously explored? Were any adopted? Were any rejected? Are any changes
    contemplated in the coming year?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Is there any identifiable duplication in capacities or services in the
    state? How many duplicative systems -- accounting systems, human resources
    management systems, case management systems, etc. -- currently exist? Does
    the service delivery system now in use minimize or eliminate duplications
    that existed prior to October 1, 1998?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Since October 1998, what innovative service delivery
    systems/mechanisms/initiatives been adopted in the state? Have any been
    explored and then rejected?<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Simultaneously with these self-evaluations, LSC will proceed
to contract with a private research firm to formally evaluate legal services
delivery systems in a selected number of states. LSC plans to select several
states that we believe are at important stages of the planning-implementation
process for an outside evaluation. If your state is chosen, you will not have to
do the self-evaluation discussed in this program letter. Moreover, LSC will
provide discretionary grants and/or technical assistance to assist with and help
defray any in-kind program costs associated with this project.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>The purpose of these evaluations will be to determine whether
or not the delivery model in use in the state has effectively implemented the
concepts and principles of a comprehensive, integrated and client-centered legal
services delivery system. LSC will study the relationship between the structure
of the delivery system and desired outcomes as articulated by the selected
states in prior planning documents. The findings of these formal evaluations --
together with the material presented in the self-evaluations --will assist LSC
and other interested stakeholders in understanding how best to conceptualize,
design and deliver comprehensive, integrated and client-centered legal services.

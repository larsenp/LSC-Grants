      The
      purpose of this program letter is to distribute the certification form
      mandated by Part 1635 of the Legal Services Corporation (&quot;LSC&quot;)
      regulations. The LSC Board of Directors have promulgated and adopted
      revisions to Part 1635, the Timekeeping Requirement. This revised final
      rule became effective on August 7, 2000. Under one section of the newly
      revised regulation, recipients of LSC funding are required to maintain
      certifications for part-time advocates (attorneys and paralegals) who also
      work for organizations that engage in restricted activities (&quot;<i>restricted
      activities</i>&quot; is defined in the regulation).</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The
      pertinent section of the revised regulation, 45 CFR Section 1635.3(d)
      provides:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Recipients
        shall require any attorney or paralegal who works part-time for the
        recipient and part-time for an organization that engages in restricted
        activities to certify in writing that the attorney or paralegal has not
        engaged in restricted activity during any time for which the attorney or
        paralegal was compensated by the recipient or has not used recipient
        resources for restricted activities. The certification requirement does
        not apply to a<i> de minimis </i>action related to a restricted
        activity. Actions consistent with the <i>de minimis </i>standard are
        those that meet all or most of the following criteria: actions that are
        of little substance; require little time; are not initiated by the
        part-time employee; and, for the most part, are unavoidable.
        Certifications shall be made on a quarterly basis and shall be made on a
        form determined by LSC.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In
      completing the form, several things should be kept in mind. First, the
      certification must only be completed by employees who are (1) either
      attorneys or paralegals, (2) part-time workers, <b><i>and</i></b> (3) work
      for an organization which performs restricted activities, as defined by
      the LSC regulations. Second, the certification requirement does not apply
      to <i>de minimis</i> activities. Of primary import, is whether the part
      time employee initiates these activities. If the covered employee receives
      an unavoidable telephone call, this would be considered <i>de minimis</i>.
      If the covered employee places a telephone call on behalf of the
      restricted activity, this would be a violative activity.</font><a href="#sup1"><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF"><sup>1</sup></font></strong></a><font color="#0000FF" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
Third, as noted
      in the &quot;Supplementary Information&quot; the requirement is a <i>record
      keeping</i> rather than a <i>reporting </i>requirement. Accordingly, these
      certificates are to be maintained by the program rather than submitted to
      LSC. The regulation does not specify the period of time these
      certifications must be maintained. Pursuant to prior LSC instructions
      mandating retention of records for at least five years, these records
      should also be maintained for at least five years.</font><a href="#sup2"><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF"><sup>2</sup></font></strong></a><font color="#0000FF" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If
      an employee is required to certify, but is not able to do so, a statement
      of explanation should be prepared by that employee and attached to the
      form. Upon receipt of this statement of non-certification, the recipient
      should immediately notify the Office of the Inspector General and/or the
      Office of Compliance and Enforcement.</font><a href="#sup3"><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#0000FF"><sup>3</sup></font></strong></a></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The
      certification form includes an <b><i>optional</i></b> Part C for those
      programs that do not have any employees who are covered by this provision.
      It allows you to record that it was determined that there were no covered
      staff during the time period. This is not required by the regulation,
      however, we provide it to assist you in documenting continued compliance
      with this regulation.</font></p>

    purpose of this program letter is to instruct all grantees to conduct a Self Inspection of
    a sample of closed cases prior to submitting 1999 Case Service Reporting (&quot;CSR&quot;)
    data to the Legal Services Corporation (&quot;LSC&quot;). The Self Inspection must be
    completed and the enclosed Certification and Summary Forms signed and returned to LSC no
    later than March 1, 2000.</font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b><font size="3"><strong>Background</strong></font><b></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    Conference Report accompanying Public Law 106-113, the appropriations law providing
    federal funding for legal services in 2000, directs LSC to make improvements to the
    accuracy of the 1999 CSR data. The Conference Report also directs the LSC Office of
    Inspector General (&quot;OIG&quot;) to assess the accuracy of the CSR data and report to
    Congress as to its accuracy no later than July 30, 2000. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    Congressional directives are in response to 1998 and 1999 audit findings by the General
    Accounting Office (&quot;GAO&quot;) and by LSC&#146;s OIG that grantees were reporting
    cases in which no legal assistance was provided, were reporting cases more than once, were
    not closing cases in a timely fashion, and were not documenting client eligibility. A
    subsequent GAO report found that efforts to correct CSR-related problems were
    insufficient. (&quot;More Needs to Be Done to Correct Case Service Reporting
    Problems&quot;, GAO/GGD-99-183, September 20, 1999.)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LSC
    is committed to providing the United States Congress and the public with the most accurate
    information possible. Until such time as new measures are in place to describe adequately
    the work which legal services programs do, closed case statistics remain the primary
    measure of the impact of federal funding on the legal problems of people living in
    poverty. Therefore, the accuracy of the 1999 CSR data is essential.</font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Standards for Accuracy</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards
    for accurate reporting of CSR data are contained in the CSR Handbook (revised November 24,
    1998). Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 5.2 of the Handbook contain specific guidance on single
    recording of cases, timely closing of cases, and documenting client eligibility. Section
    VI of the Handbook contains guidance on the reporting of different levels of case
    services, and Section VII contains guidance on the reporting of referrals. In addition,
    LSC Program Letter 99-3 provides guidance on documenting client eligibility, and a set of
    Frequently Asked Questions about case service reporting is available at the Recipient
    Information Network Bulletin Board.</font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">The Self Inspection Process</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    purpose of the Self Inspection process is to give programs a means to verify, by reviewing
    a sample of cases, that their 1999 CSR data meets LSC&#146;s standards for accuracy. The
    enclosed Case Review Form contains a list of questions which identify key requirements
    which need to be met in order to report a case to LSC. If the answers to the questions in
    the Case Review Form are generally &quot;Yes&quot;, then the sampled cases generally meet
    the requirements for reporting cases to LSC, and no further inquiry is necessary, unless
    program staff have reason to believe that the sample selected was not representative of
    the total number of cases to be reported to LSC or, for other reasons, problems outside
    the sample would affect the accuracy of the 1999 CSR data. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
    there are &quot;No&quot; answers to applicable questions in 10 percent or more of the
    cases sampled in the Self Inspection process, then the sample of cases tends to indicate
    that there are overall problems which may affect the accuracy of the 1999 CSR data. In the
    event that the Self Inspection process does reveal such problems, then consultation with
    LSC is appropriate to determine whether to initiate corrective action to find and correct
    problems in cases not included in the Self Inspection sample. <i><b>Under no circumstances
    should action be taken to correct problems in sampled cases without action to correct
    similar problems in cases not included in the sample. In the event of a future audit,
    there would be a review of cases not included in the Self Inspection sample. Therefore, if
    problems exist outside the sample, the future audit would disclose them, and if the Self
    Inspection had not disclosed similar problems, the Self Inspection results would be
    suspect. </b></i>To consult with an LSC staff member about corrective action, contact John
    Meyer at (202) 336-8909, e-mail <a href="mailto:meyerj@lsc.gov">meyerj@lsc.gov</a>. </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Sample Selection</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
    reach a level of absolute confidence that every 1999 closed case is accurately reported to
    LSC, program staff would need to review each individual case. For most programs, such a
    review would be impractical. Therefore, the Self Inspection process relies on the
    selection of a sample of cases from which programs can draw some inferences about the
    overall number of cases reported to LSC. In order for the inferences to be reliable,
    however, the sample must be reasonably representative of the total number of cases
    reported to LSC. If the sample is not representative, then a future audit would likely
    produce different results, thereby undermining the integrity of the Self Inspection
    results.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    enclosed Sample Selection Procedure details a process for selecting a sample of cases for
    review. The Procedure requires programs reporting over 1,000 total closed cases to select
    a sample of approximately 150 closed cases. Programs reporting fewer than 1,000 total
    closed cases will need to select a sample of 75 closed cases. Each grantee should document
    the steps taken in the Selection Procedure, and should clearly indicate any departures
    from the Selection Procedure. To consult with an LSC staff member about the sampling
    procedure, contact Bert Thomas at (202) 336-8938, e-mail <a href="mailto:thomasb@lsc.gov">thomasb@lsc.gov</a>.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Review of Sampled Cases</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
    each case in the sample, the enclosed Case Review Form must be completed, and a
    &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer must be recorded for all applicable questions.
    Not all questions will be applicable to all cases. For example, questions 1 through 3 are
    not applicable to certain cases where financial eligibility determinations are not
    permitted by law. Upon completion, each Case Review Form must be retained for audit
    purposes.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
    questions in the Case Review Form require a determination whether a &quot;notation&quot;
    is present in the case file or case management system record. The following standards
    apply to these questions:</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Questions (1) and (3) &#150; Notation indicating no
    income or assets</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">A notation indicating that a client household has no
      income or assets may be the number zero, the word &#145;none&#146; or a similar
      descriptive term to that effect, or a checkmark or a line drawn through the applicable
      section of an intake sheet. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Question (3) - Receipt of government benefits</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">A notation indicating that a client receives government
      benefits which required testing for assets may be the name of the government agency, or a
      brief description of the type of benefits received.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Question (4) &#150; Citizenship or alien eligibility
    &#150; telephone cases</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">A notation indicating that a client in a telephone case
      is a citizen or an eligible alien may be the word &quot;Yes&quot;, the letter
      &quot;Y&quot;, or a checkmark or other written indication in the appropriate section of an
      intake sheet. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Question (5) &#150; Attestation of citizenship</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">The attestation may consist of a signature on an intake
      sheet, retainer agreement or other document containing language stating that the client is
      a United States citizen.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Use of Case Management System Queries</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LSC
    encourages programs to use their case management systems to augment the Self Inspection
    process. Case management system queries and reports can easily provide useful information
    about all 1999 closed cases, not just a sample of cases. For example, a case management
    system query could readily identify 1999 cases which lack either income or assets
    information. For assistance with case management system queries, contact your vendor or
    LSC staff member Glenn Rawdon at (202) 336-8868, e-mail <a href="mailto:grawdon@lsc.gov">grawdon@lsc.gov</a>.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Whether to Initiate Corrective Action </font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
    there are &quot;No&quot; answers to applicable questions in 10 percent or more of the
    cases sampled, or if the use of case management system queries reveals problems in a
    larger number of cases, then program staff will need to make a determination whether to
    initiate corrective action to remedy the problems identified. <i><b>Under no circumstances
    should corrective action be undertaken to address problems in sampled cases without
    implementation of action to correct similar problems in cases not included in the sample.
    In the event of a future audit, there would be a review of cases not included in the Self
    Inspection sample. Therefore, if problems exist outside the sample, the future audit would
    disclose them.</font></p>
    </b></i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
    some problems, such as untimely closing of cases or duplicate reporting of cases in a
    particular branch office or unit, an expenditure of effort to identify the total number of
    affected cases might be justified. Case management system queries and reports could
    provide an easy means of detecting such cases. In the interest of achieving accurate
    reporting of 1999 closed cases, further effort to correct problems might also be
    justified, provided doing so would not have a disproportionate impact on client services.
    While the decision to undertake corrective action rests with the affected program, LSC
    strongly encourages consultation prior to the initiation of any corrective action. To
    consult with an LSC staff member about whether corrective action is advisable, contact
    John Meyer at (202) 336-8909, e-mail <a href="mailto:meyerj@lsc.gov">meyerj@lsc.gov</a>.</font></p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Certification Process</font></p>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
    programs must submit the enclosed Self Inspection Certification and Summary Forms to LSC
    by March 1, 2000, regardless of the results of the Self Inspection. The Certification Form
    requires submission of information about the numbers of cases found to have problems in
    the Self Inspection, as well as information about whether action was taken before, during,
    or after the Self Inspection either to remedy problems found or not to report some cases
    at all. The purpose of collecting this information is to enable LSC to determine the
    frequency with which programs are unable to report cases because they do not meet
    LSC&#146;s reporting requirements.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    Self Inspection Summary Form collects information about the types and frequency of
    exceptions noted during the Self Inspection process. The twelve categories listed in the
    Summary Form correspond with the twelve questions in the Case Review Form. The
    &quot;Numbers of Cases&quot; column in the Summary Form should accurately reflect the
    numbers of sampled cases for which exceptions were noted (by &quot;No&quot; answers) in
    the completion of the Case Review Forms for cases sampled. The collection of this
    information will enable LSC and program staff to identify those areas where LSC&#146;s
    reporting requirements have been difficult to meet, as well as to indicate where programs
    should focus their efforts to achieve further improvements in the accuracy of their case
    reporting. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    Self Inspection Summary Form also collects information about whether programs undertook
    any corrective action, as a result of the Self Inspection process, which resulted in
    adjustments to the 1999 CSR data submitted to LSC. If corrective action is undertaken, it
    should apply not just to cases in the Self Inspection sample, but also in affected cases
    outside the sample. Programs undertaking corrective action which resulted in adjustments
    to the 1999 CSR data submitted to LSC should note the categories in which they have taken
    corrective action in the Self Inspection Summary Form. This information will enable LSC to
    determine the extent to which programs have been able to correct problems identified
    during the Self Inspection process.</font></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">The purpose of this Program Letter is to remind all recipients of 
    Legal Services Corporation ("LSC" or the "Corporation") funding that asset determinations 
    for each applicant for legal assistance must be documented as part of the recipient's 
    eligibility determination, that a written citizenship attestation is required for each 
    citizen who applies in person for legal assistance, and documentation of eligible alien 
    status is required of all non-citizens who apply in person for legal assistance. These 
    actions are required in order to ensure compliance with the LSC Act and regulations, and 
    to ensure the accuracy and reliability of information provided in Case Service Reports to 
    LSC and the United States Congress.</font></p>  
    <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">LSC's management has discovered through on-site reviews, audits by 
    the General Accounting Office, and discussions with recipients regarding the Case Service 
    Reporting Self-Inspection Procedure that, while many recipients make appropriate inquiry 
    regarding an applicant's assets, neither such inquiry nor the applicant's responses are 
    consistently documented. Moreover, it has come to our attention that citizenship/alien 
    eligibility documentation is absent in many instances of brief advice and consultation 
    provided to persons applying, in person, for legal assistance.  Although the extent of this 
    oversight is unknown, all recipients are reminded to document the asset determination for 
    each applicant for legal assistance.  In addition, recipients are reminded that citizenship 
    attestations, or documentation of alien eligibility as appropriate, are required of each 
    applicant for legal assistance who appears in person, as well as any client who receives 
    continuous representation.  All such documentation is to be preserved and maintained in the 
    client's file.<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a></font><b></p>
    </b><p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">LSC regulations and program instructions require that recipients 
    document and preserve asset information obtained from each applicant for legal assistance.  
    Recipients are required to adopt a simple form to obtain information to determine eligibility, 
    and preserve the information so obtained.  45 CFR 1611.7(a).  There is nothing in the regulations 
    to suggest that the use of the term "eligibility" is limited to income.  Rather, the regulations 
    establish that the information which recipients must obtain in order to determine financial 
    eligibility includes both income and asset information.  Accordingly, consistent with 45 CFR 
    1611.6(c), recipients are instructed to identify and document all of the liquid and non-liquid 
    assets of all persons who are resident members of a family unit, as provided by each recipient's 
    asset guidelines established pursuant to 45 CFR 1611.6.  Such assets may include, but are not 
    limited to, savings, checking accounts, real property (except that the recipient may exclude 
    the client's principal residence), personal property (except that the reasonable equity value in 
    essential work related equipment of the applicant or a member of the family unit may be excluded 
    if the owner is attempting to produce income consistent with the fair market value of such equipment), 
    stocks, bonds, investments, etc.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">Regarding the documentation requirements relative to citizenship/alien 
    eligibility, LSC regulations require that all applicants for legal assistance who claim to be 
    citizens attest, in writing, that they are citizens.  45 CFR 1626.6(a).  Consistent, with the 
    supplementary information published in connection with Part 1626, until such time as LSC provides 
    a standard attestation form, recipients should continue to use their current attestation forms.  
    <i>See</i>, Fed. Reg. Vol. 62, No. 79, page 19,412 (April 21, 1997).  All such citizenship 
    attestations are to be preserved and maintained in the client's file.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">LSC regulations also require that aliens seeking legal assistance 
    submit appropriate documents to verify eligibility.  45 CFR 1626.7(a).  Documents appropriate 
    to verify alien eligibility are identified in the appendix to Part 1626.  Where it is 
    permissible to copy such documents, such copies are to be preserved and maintained in the 
    applicant/client's file.  In other instances, where it is impermissible to copy the documentation 
    verifying eligibility, a description of the document, containing the name of the issuing 
    agency, the date of issuance, and relevant form numbers, is to be maintained, in lieu of a 
    copy of the document, in the client's file.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">The only exceptions to the citizenship attestation/alien eligibility 
    documentation requirements discussed supra are for those instances where the only LSC funded 
    legal assistance provided by the recipient is advice or brief service by telephone, which 
    does not include continuous representation, and persons who receive only intake or referral 
    services.  In other words, where the only contact between the recipient and the applicant 
    for legal assistance is by telephone, and the LSC funded legal assistance provided by the 
    recipient does not exceed advice or brief service, the documentation requirements set forth 
    at 45 CFR 1626.6(a) and 1626.7(a) are inapplicable.  Nonetheless, LSC requires that recipients 
    make appropriate inquiry of each and every telephone applicant and record such inquiry and 
    response(s).  All such documentation should be maintained in the client file.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
    FACE="Times New Roman">In those instances where an ineligible alien seeks legal assistance, 
    recipients may complete intake and either reject the applicant or refer the applicant to a 
    private attorney (other than a participating PAI attorney), a non-LSC funded legal services 
    provider, or a non-legal organization that provides immigration assistance.  Since such applicants 
    are not "eligible clients", as defined by 45 CFR 1600.1, and the recipient cannot accept the 
    request for legal assistance, the documentation requirements set forth at 45 CFR 1626.6(a) 
    and 1626.7(a) are inapplicable.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font

    questions, please feel free to contact my office.</font></p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recipients are further reminded that pursuant 
    to 42 USC § 2996g(b), the Corporation requires that closed client files be retained for five 
    years.  If the law in your state permits the retention of closed client files for a period of 
    less than five years, recipients are instructed to follow the Corporation's five-year retention 
    period.  If the law of your state requires retention for a period of time longer than five years, 
    then recipients should follow the law of their state.</font></p>

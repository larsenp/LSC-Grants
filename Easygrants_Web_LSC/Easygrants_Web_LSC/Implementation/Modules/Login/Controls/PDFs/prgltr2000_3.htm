    <font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"
    color="#000000">The Legal Services Corporation has decided to delay publication of the
    planned 2000 CSR Handbook. In lieu of a new handbook, LSC is issuing Program Letter 2000-3
    which contains amendments to the 1999 CSR Handbook. In delaying the publication of a new
    handbook, LSC is responding to numerous requests from project directors that no new case
    service reporting directives be given at this time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">For the most part, these
    amendments were developed to meet the recommendations of the GAO that certain sections be
    clarified. The amendments outlined in Program Letter 2000-3 are effective for the entirety
    of the year 2000, except as specified below. The timekeeping amendment is not retroactive
    and will take effect on July 1, 2000. Most of these amendments reflect requirements
    already in effect for reporting of cases to LSC. Others are clarifications of requirements
    and one (Section 3.3(a)) eases requirements. One amendment adds a new Section 2.3 and
    includes timekeeping for staff acting in a paralegal capacity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The following sections of the 1999 CSR Handbook are amended</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp; Section II by adding Section 2.3;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp; Section 3.3, by revising Section 3.3(a);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp; Section 4.3 by revising the current text and adding Section 4.3(b);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp; Section 4.5 is revised for clarification;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp; Section V is completely revised;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -&nbsp; Section IX is new.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Each amendment is set out below with a brief explanation:</font></p>
    <u><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">AMENDMENT TO SECTION II, KEY
    DEFINITIONS</font></p>
    </u><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A new Section 2.3 is added to Section II. It is effective January 1, 2000, except that the
    requirement that staff acting in the capacity of paralegals must keep time as required by
    45 CFR Part 1635 is new and does not take effect until July 1, 2000. The new section reads
    as follows:</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000"><a NAME="_Toc476563589">2.3</a></b>&nbsp;

    </b><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Legal assistance in a case must be provided by an attorney authorized to practice law in
    the jurisdiction where assistance is rendered, or a person acting in the capacity of a
    paralegal under the supervision of a licensed attorney in accordance with local rules of
    practice in the jurisdiction where the grantee provides assistance. A person providing
    assistance in a case need not have the job title of &quot;attorney&quot; or
    &quot;paralegal&quot;, but any such individual must be capable of providing legal
    assistance in accordance with local rules of practice, and must keep records of their time
    as required by 45 CFR Part 1635. </font></p>
    <u><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">AMENDMENT TO SECTION 3.3,
    TIMELY CLOSING OF CASES</font></p>
    </u><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Section 3.3(a) is amended to allow Counsel and Advice, Brief Service or Referred After
    Legal Assessment cases opened after September 30 of a year to be closed either in that
    year or in the succeeding year, without any further justification for the closing date, so
    as to avoid unnecessary loss of cases that were not closed before the end of the year but
    which had not been open for a long period of time. The new subsection reads as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">(a) cases in which the only
    assistance provided to the client is Counsel and Advice, Brief Service, a referral after
    legal assessment (CSR Categories A, B, and C), shall be reported as having been closed in
    the year in which the counsel and advice or brief service was completed, unless:</font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">(i) the case is opened after
      September 30, in which circumstance it may be reported either in the year opened or the
      following year; or<br>
      (ii) there is a determination
      (which should be noted in the file or in the case management system) that the case should
      be held open into the following year because further assistance is likely to be provided
      to the client.</font></p>

    <u><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">SECTION 4.3, INCLUSION OF

    </u><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This section is retitled and amended to include in the types of cases to be reported to
    LSC cases under Titles III and IV of the Older Americans Act, Title XX of the Social
    Security Act and the Violence Against Women Act regardless of financial eligibility. The
    section is amended to read as follows:</font><a NAME="_Toc476563598"> <b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">4.3 </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recipients
    should report all cases in which there has been an eligibility determination showing that
    the client meets LSC eligibility requirements, regardless of the source(s) of funding
    supporting the cases. However, cases without such determinations are not to be reported to
    LSC, except as provided in Section 4.3(b). This section does not require that programs
    document client financial eligibility for any cases not reported to LSC that are wholly
    funded by non-LSC funding sources. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">(b)
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, programs should report cases
    in which financial eligibility determinations are not permitted by conditions attaching to
    federal funding for representation of the elderly and victims of domestic violence under
    Titles III and IV of the Older Americans Act, Title XX of the Social Security Act and the
    Violence Against Women Act provided that these cases otherwise meet the requirements of
    this Handbook, such as the citizenship/alien eligibility requirement stated in Section
    5.5. </font></p>

    There have been comments that this brief section is unclear, so it is revised for greater
    clarity with no change in its substance. The revised section reads as follows:</font></p>
    <b><a NAME="_Toc476563600"><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">4.5

    </u><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This section is entirely replaced. The requirements are no more than was required under
    the 1999 Self-Inspection criteria to report a case to LSC. Indeed, the asset documentation
    and citizenship eligibility requirements stated below represent a simplification of the
    requirements of Program Letter 99-3. The new section reads as follows:</font></p>

    For each case reported to LSC, programs shall record case and client information necessary
    for effective case management, either through notations on an intake sheet or other
    hard-copy document in a case file, or through electronic entries in an automated case
    management system database, or through other appropriate means. For each case reported to
    LSC, such information shall describe (at a minimum) the information required in §§5.2,
    5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 of this amended Handbook and:</font> </p>

    In addition, for each case reported to LSC, programs shall document that a determination
    of client eligibility was made in accordance with LSC requirements including sections 5.3,
    5.4 and 5.5 below. The documentation of eligibility shall be recorded electronically in a
    case management system record, or in a simple form as provided by 45 CFR Section
    1611.7(a), and shall be preserved for audit purposes for a period of five years. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Except for cases funded through Titles III and IV of the Older Americans Act, Title XX of
    the Social Security Act, the Violence Against Women Act and other federally-funded
    programs where financial eligibility determinations are not permitted, the documentation
    of eligibility shall include income and asset information as set forth in Sections 5.3 and
    5.4. Furthermore, all documentation of eligibility shall include information on
    citizenship or alien eligibility as set forth by Section 5.5.</font></p>

    At a minimum, for each case reported to LSC, programs shall document the total value of
    assets--except for categories of assets excluded from consideration pursuant to recipient
    Board guidelines adopted under 45 CFR §§1611.6(c) and (d) -- held by all members of the
    applicant&#146;s family unit.<a href="#sup4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    45 CFR 1611.6, as sufficient for client asset eligibility, a notation that the applicant
    is eligible under such program may be substituted for recording the total value of assets.
    In support of such notation, the program must have on file a resolution, minutes or other
    written evidence of action by its Board stating that eligibility for such program

    Pursuant to 45 CFR Sections 1626.6(a) and 1626.7(a), the level of documentation necessary
    to evidence citizenship or alien eligibility depends on the nature of the service provided
    to the client. For cases involving Counsel and Advice or Brief Service (CSR Categories A
    and B) provided exclusively over the telephone, the documentation of eligibility shall
    include a written notation or computer entry which reflects the client&#146;s oral
    response to the program&#146;s inquiry as to whether the client is a U.S. citizen or an
    eligible alien.<a href="#sup6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></a></font></p>

    eligibility shall include either: (a) a written attestation of citizenship, or (b)
    documentation of alien eligibility, as required by 45 CFR Sections 1626.6(a) and
    1626.7(a). A client&#146;s signature on an intake sheet or other document which contains a
    statement that the client is a United States citizen constitutes a signed attestation for

      requirement of Section 5.3 is limited to recording total income. However,
      programs’ intake procedures must include instructions to ask sufficient

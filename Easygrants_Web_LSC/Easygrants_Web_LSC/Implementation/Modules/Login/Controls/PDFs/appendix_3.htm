        <p>Organized pro bono programs have existed in the country for over a century and have
        played a vital role in providing access to justice by assisting members of the private bar
        in their efforts to furnish free civil legal services directly to persons of limited
        means. In the past 15 years the growth in the number of programs has been remarkable: in
        1980, 80 pro bono programs were identified by the American Bar Association; today, there
        are more than 900. The variety, sophistication and complexity of programs and program
        structures similarly have grown and that growth is expected to continue. Given this growth
        and the period of change and re-invention in which existing programs are operating and new
        programs are being established, it seems appropriate to develop standards that will aid
        programs in becoming more effective and efficient in marshaling volunteers, meeting
        clients' needs and facilitating the provision of high quality legal service. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>In 1961, the American Bar Association first adopted standards for the operation of
        civil legal aid programs. The most recent version of those standards, the <u>Standards for
        Providers of Civil Legal Services to the Poor</u> (hereinafter &quot;Civil
        Standards&quot;), was adopted in 1986. While the Civil Standards were designed to provide
        guidance to all organizations serving the civil legal needs for the poor, it was
        recognized that some of those standards would not be applicable to pro bono programs due
        to legal, practical and institutional reasons. Moreover, many issues unique to pro bono
        programs were not addressed in the Civil Standards. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>It is the goal of the Pro Bono Standards to furnish current guidance to newly
        established programs and their governing bodies and to provide a basis for improving and
        evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of existing programs. These standards
        recognize that to utilize all resources effectively, programs should strive to develop a
        variety of methods for delivering high quality services to clients. These methods may
        include the most common one of program staff referring individual clients to individual
        attorneys for representation, or the use of &quot;full service clinics&quot; at which
        volunteers conduct in-depth interviews with clients and agree to provide whatever level of
        assistance is needed. In addition, programs may explore developing supplemental means of
        utilizing volunteers by establishing advice clinics, legal hotlines and pro se clinics
        through which clients' legal needs may be addressed. Another approach put forth is
        developing relationships with entities such as law firms or corporate counsels' offices
        through which multiple matters are referred at the same time and an individual at the
        entity is responsible for placement of the matters, with oversight being provided, when
        possible, through the entity's usual quality assurances mechanisms. While it is recognized
        that a program's ability to implement a variety of delivery models will depend upon local
        conditions and resources, the Pro Bono Standards encourage all programs to carefully
        consider the best way to leverage their resources to effectively and efficiently address
        clients' legal needs. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>As guidelines only, the Pro Bono Standards are not intended to create any mandatory
        requirements or minimum standards for performance. Thus, failure to comply with a standard
        should not give rise to a cause or action, nor should it create any inference or
        presumption that a pro bono program has failed to comply with any legal duty owed to a
        client, a volunteer or a funding source. Of course, all lawyers and those working under
        their supervision must comply with all applicable rules of professional conduct when
        providing pro bono service. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p><u>Application of the Standards</u> <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>The Pro Bono Standards have been crafted specifically for programs and components of
        programs which provide free civil legal services through the use of volunteers to persons
        of limited means and the organizations serving them. It is likely, however, that all pro
        bono programs will obtain guidance from a review of these Standards. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>There are a number of pro bono programs that, in addition to utilizing volunteers to
        provide free civil legal services to persons of limited means, employ staff to carry out
        that same function. There are also many programs established primarily as staff model
        legal services organizations that include a volunteer component. The Pro Bono Standards
        are meant to apply only to the pro bono component of such programs. They are not intended
        to provide guidance to those components of programs in which staff lawyers provide
        representation. In establishing operational guidelines for the staff component, such
        programs should turn to the Civil Standards. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>While judicare and contract programs in which private attorneys are paid a reduced fee
        to provide free legal services to persons of limited means are likely to find a review of
        the Pro Bono Standards instructive, the unique issues faced by such programs are not
        addressed in these standards. In addition, the Pro Bono Standards are not intended to be
        applicable to law school and law firm pro bono programs due to their distinctive missions
        and operations. The same holds true for some programs that are organized to address
        certain types of special issues such as civil rights and civil liberties. All such
        programs may nevertheless obtain guidance from a review of the Standards. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>Even those programs to which the Pro Bono Standards are intended to apply may find that
        not every standard is helpful to them due to their special characteristics, their method
        of service delivery or the community in which they operate. For example, those programs
        that only provide assistance to pro se litigants will find that much of the discussion on
        case placement, tracking and oversight, and attorneys' fees policies (among other areas)
        are not relevant to their operation. Likewise, programs that provide legal services only
        to a particular population, such as children, will need to adapt, for example, the
        discussion regarding establishment or relationships to fit the unique situations that they
        face. Furthermore, the extent to which programs can rely upon staff model legal services
        programs to provide assistance in areas such as training and support, as the Pro Bono </p>
        <p>Standards recommend, will vary depending upon the size and resources of those staff
        programs, as well as the type and scope of services that they provide. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>There are special conditions under which rural pro bono programs operate due to the
        characteristics of their communities and legal institutions which must be recognized.
        Specifically, rural areas usually have a limited number of attorneys who are spread
        throughout a region, and those regions often lack active, well organized bar associations.
        While strategies for addressing some of the special problems faced by rural programs are
        suggested in specific standards, such programs may find that some standards are not
        relevant to them, and some may not be attainable. Standards that fall within these
        categories may include those that address the role of the organized bar, the role of a
        centralized governing body and establishing special panels to address conflicts of
        interest. All programs, be they specialized as to function, client group or location,
        should review the Pro Bono Standards with an understanding that they are intended as goals
        to be achieved and may not fully reflect the reality in which each program operates. <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p><u>Definitions of Significant Terms Used in the Standards</u> <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>It is recognized that in the pro bono context, two distinct attorney-client
        relationships may exist: one between the client and the volunteer, and one between the
        client and the program. As used throughout the Standards, however, the term <strong>&quot;client&quot;</strong>
        refers to an individual or group who receives advice, counsel or representation from a
        program volunteer, whether or not that individual or group also stands in an
        attorney-client relationship with the program. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>The terms <strong>&quot;legal services program&quot; </strong>and <strong>&quot;staff
        model legal services program&quot; </strong>are used interchangeably and refer to any
        program, regardless of its funding source, that provides free legal services to the poor
        primarily through the use of paid staff who directly represent clients. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>The term <strong>&quot;persons of limited means&quot;</strong> refers to those who
        qualify for participation in programs funded by the Legal Services Corporation and those
        whose incomes and financial resources are slightly above the guidelines utilized by such
        programs but nevertheless, cannot afford counsel. It is the same definition used in ABA
        Model Rule of </p>
        <p>Professional Conduct 6.1 which sets forth an aspirational standard for pro bono service
        by lawyers. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>A conscious decision has been made to avoid the use of the term &quot;pro bono
        coordinator&quot; in these Standards. Instead, the term <strong>&quot;pro bono
        manager&quot; </strong>is used to refer to the individual who has primary responsibility
        for the day to day operation of the program. This new term has been chosen because it
        better reflects the wide range of duties involved in successfully operating a program as
        well as the professionalism required of the individual who holds the position. <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>For the purpose of these Standards, the term <strong>&quot;pro bono program&quot; </strong>does
        not include all organizations that provide pro bono service as defined in Model Rule of
        Professional Conduct 6.1. Rather, it refers to the specific type of pro bono program - an
        organization that provides free civil legal services through the use of volunteers to
        persons of limited means or organizations serving them. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>The term <strong>&quot;provider of legal services&quot; </strong>and <strong>&quot;legal
        services provider&quot;</strong> are used interchangeable and refer to an organization
        founded primarily to render free or reduced fee civil legal services to persons of limited
        means or those who cannot otherwise afford counsel. Examples of such providers include pro
        bono programs, legal services programs, law school clinics and judicare programs. <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>While there is no attempt to define the terms &quot;case&quot; or &quot;matter&quot;,
        it should be noted that those terms are used interchangeably throughout this document, and
        they are not limited to legal problems that can only be resolved through litigation. <br

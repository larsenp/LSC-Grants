<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each LSC recipient's<font
face="WP TypographicSymbols"> </font>governing body is required
under 45 CFR 1610 to certify by December 19, 1997, and annually
thereafter, that the program is in compliance with the program
integrity requirements of section 1610.8. This section requires a
recipient to have &quot;objective integrity and
independence&quot; from any organization which engages in
restricted activities as defined in 45 CFR 1610. This memorandum
and the attached documents are intended to provide guidance on
the certification process and the requirements of 45 CFR 1610.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 1610 was adopted to
implement Congressional restrictions on the use of non-LSC funds
and to assure that no LSC-funded entity shall engage in
restricted activity. A list of restricted activities can be found
at 45 CFR 1610.2(a)<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a>
and (b). They include, among other things, lobbying,
participation in class actions, representation of prisoners, and
claiming, or collecting and retaining attorneys' fees. Under this
regulation, an LSC recipient cannot itself engage in such
activities, transfer<b><i> </i></b>LSC funds to another
organization which engages in restricted activity,<a href="#sup2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a>
or use recipient resources to subsidize the restricted activity
of another organization.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recipients may transfer<i> non</i>-LSC
funds to<b><i> </i></b>another organization which engages in
restricted activity if, and only if, the other organization is a
legally separate entity<a href="#sup3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a>
and the LSC recipient maintains objective integrity and
independence from it. Even where there is no transfer of funds,
the LSC recipient must maintain objective integrity and
independence from any organization which engages in restricted
activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the objective integrity
and independence test, a recipient must be organized so it is <i>physically
and financially separate</i> from the other organization. Mere
bookkeeping separation is insufficient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine whether there is
sufficient physical and financial separation, a range of factors,
including the following, must be considered:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>existence of separate personnel; </li>
        <li>existence of separate accounting and timekeeping
            records;</li>
        <li>degree of separation from facilities in which
            restricted activities occur, and the extent of such
            activities; and</li>
        <li>the extent to which signs and other forms of
            identification which distinguish the recipient from
            the other organization are present.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence or absence of any
one or more factors will not be determinative. Each situation
will be viewed on a case-by-case, totality of the circumstances
basis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recipient governing bodies must
consider the same factors when preparing the enclosed <a
href="cert_form.htm">Certification of Program Integrity</a>. To
assist recipients and their governing bodies, additional guidance
is contained in the <a href="cert_inst.htm">instructions to the
Certification form</a> and the attached <a href="cert_guide.htm">Guidance
in Applying the Program Integrity Standards</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any questions,
please contact Anh Tu at (202) 336-8946 or Bob Gross at (202)
336-8856.</p>

SERVICES CORPORATION AWARDS FINAL FY 1999 GRANTS</strong></font><br>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) today announced FY 1999
competitive grant awards to local programs in Colorado, Michigan,
New Mexico, Ohio, and California. Since 1996, LSC has awarded all
grant funds through a system of competition designed to select
the program with the best capability to deliver high-quality and
effective civil legal services to poor clients. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LSC awarded the grants as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>For Service Area MI-3, Wayne County (Detroit), MI,
            LSC chose Legal Aid and Defender Association, an
            existing legal aid provider and first-time LSC
            recipient. </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>For Service Area NM-4, the Santa Fe, NM, area, the
            current provider, Northern New Mexico Legal Services,
            Inc., was again selected. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>In Service Area OH-9, Butler and Warren counties, OH,
            LSC awarded the grant to Legal Aid Society of
            Cincinnati. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>In Service Area CA-6, Alameda County (Oakland), CA,
            LSC determined that neither applicant met the
            requirements of the competition regulation.
            Additionally, as part of an ongoing process of state
            planning, LSC has decided that for the FY 2000 grants
            process, it will reconfigure the Bay Area's six
            service areas into one. For both these reasons, LSC
            will seek to continue to work with the interim
            provider, San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance
            Foundation, until the reconfigured service area is
            competed in 1999. This will minimize disruption to
            client services. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>In Service Areas CO-2, NCO-1, and MCO, covering part
            of Denver, Colorado, LSC awarded the FY 1999 grant to
            Colorado Rural Legal Services, Inc., (CRLS) for six
            months and will recompete the service area. During
            the period of recompetition, CRLS will continue to
            provide services (with conditions to their grant) to
            eligible clients in the service area until June 30,
            1999, at which time LSC expects to have completed the
            recompetition and selected a permanent provider for
            the remainder of the eligible grant term. </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LSC President John McKay said, &quot;The U.S. Congress has
encouraged competition for grants as a way of promoting
innovation and higher quality in the delivery of legal services
to low-income Americans with critical legal needs. We believe
today's grant decisions further those goals to the ultimate
benefit of our clients: victims of abuse, the elderly, children,
veterans, and other vulnerable individuals.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Information about funding is available to the public on LSC's
website (www.lsc.gov) and to recipients on the internal website
(RIN). </p>

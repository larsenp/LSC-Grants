    <p style="text-align: justify">The purpose of this program letter is to inform all
    programs of the due date for submission of annual Grant Activity Reports and to reiterate
    the need for accurate case service reporting (CSR). Because CSR statistics are a mainstay
    of the budget request which the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) submits to the United
    States Congress each year, accurate reporting of case information is vital to obtaining
    continued Federal funding for legal services.<br>
    <b></p>
    <p>1998-99 Grant Activity Reports</p>
    </b><p style="text-align: justify">Grant Activity Reports are due on March 1 this year.
    All recipients of 1998 and 1999 grants are required to submit grant activity reports for
    the year(s) in which they receive LSC funding. As in previous years, the Grant Activity
    Reports and instructions are accessible through the Recipient Information Network at <a
    href="http://www.rin.lsc.gov">http://www.rin.lsc.gov</a> . Additional information about
    the Grant Activity Reports is available at that site.</p>
    <b><p>Reporting Federal Funding to Combat Domestic Violence</p>
    </b><p style="text-align: justify">This year, for the first time, we are asking programs
    to report amounts of funding received from other Federal sources specifically for
    assisting clients who are victims of domestic violence. In its annual budget request, LSC
    has requested funding to address domestic violence. Information about the extent to which
    programs have been able to obtain other funding for domestic violence issues will be
    helpful to our budget request. Therefore, Forms D-3 and D-4 of the 1998-99 Grant Activity
    Reports contain a line for indicating amounts of such funding. Otherwise, the format and
    content of the Grant Activity Reports are essentially the same as last year.</p>
    <b><p>Accurate Case Service Reporting</p>
    </b><p style="text-align: justify">On May 12, 1998, LSC issued Program Letter 98-3 in an
    effort to maintain the quality of CSR information reported to LSC. That program letter
    explained that programs <b>should not include the following in 1998 CSR data reported to
    LSC</b>:</p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" width="85%">

      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p style="text-align: justify">On November 24, 1998, LSC issued Program
    Letter 98-8 and a revised CSR Handbook to emphasize further the importance of accurate
    case reporting. The revised Handbook contains new requirements for reviewing CSR
    information prior to its submission to LSC. When reviewing 1998 CSR data, all programs
    should ensure that data submitted to LSC does not include restricted or ineligible cases
    as described in items (1) through (4) above.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The need for revising the CSR Handbook and issuing Program
    Letters 98-3 and 98-8 resulted from on-site visits which revealed that some programs were
    misapplying the CSR Handbook and consequently were incorrectly classifying and reporting
    cases to LSC. Because correct classification and reporting of LSC-supported cases is
    important to measuring each program<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s services
    to its clients and our national program<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s
    services to all our clients, we need to take reasonable and necessary steps to ensure the
    accuracy of 1998 CSR data. Therefore, LSC will conduct selected on-site reviews of
    programs during 1999 to confirm that applicable provisions in the CSR Handbook and in
    Program Letters 98-3 and 98-8 are being followed, and that 1998 CSR statistics reported to
    LSC are accurate.</p>
    <b><p>Case Service Reporting for 1999 Cases</p>
    </b><p style="text-align: justify">The revised CSR Handbook contains several significant
    changes for reporting of 1999 cases in early 2000. The changes include requirements to
    report certain wholly non-LSC funded cases and to conduct systematic reviews of case
    service information to ensure cases are closed in a timely fashion and are not reported to
    LSC more than once in the same year. On or about March 1, 1999, LSC will be posting on the
    Recipient Information Network Bulletin Board a summary of frequently asked questions and
    answers about the revised Handbook.<br>

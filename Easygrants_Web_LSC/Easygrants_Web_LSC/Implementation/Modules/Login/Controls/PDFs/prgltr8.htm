<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House of Representatives
has recently considered legislation which would amend the
Government Performance and Results Act (&quot;GPRA&quot;) to
require Inspectors General to verify and validate data used in
performance measures reported to the United States Congress by
Federal agencies. Case statistics reported by legal services
programs play a vital role in Annual Performance Plans which LSC
submits to Congress under GPRA, as well as in LSC's annual
requests for Federal funding for legal services.<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognize that counting
cases is only one measure of the many services which legal
services programs provide to the client community. Development of
a survey for gathering information about other measures,
including case outcomes, matters and declinations, is underway at
LSC. We expect the survey to lead to a thorough discussion about
what measures LSC and legal services programs should employ to
describe the impact of Federal funding on the delivery of legal
services to eligible clients. We invite you to participate in
that discussion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until such time that additional
measures are in place, case statistics will continue as the
mainstay of our annual request for Federal funding for legal
services. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of case
statistics which programs report to LSC for 1998 and 1999 is
essential. All staff who have a role in opening, closing, or
recording cases must have access to LSC guidance on reporting
cases, and programs must take necessary steps to ensure that
systems are in place to ensure accurate reporting of cases
statistics to LSC. </p>

<p><b><u>Revision and Reissuance of the CSR Handbook</u></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the great need for
accurate information about cases, and in order to ensure
consistency in the reporting of CSR data, LSC is issuing a
revised <a href="newcsr.htm">CSR Handbook</a>. Two copies are
enclosed with this letter. We ask that you distribute a copy of
the revised Handbook to all staff involved in assisting clients
or in preparing case service information for submission to LSC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several significant
changes in the Handbook. These changes, which take effect for
1999 cases to be reported to LSC in 2000, include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements to use
        automated case management systems;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements to report
        LSC-eligible cases, regardless of funding source;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements to report PAI
        cases separately from Basic Field cases;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procedures for ensuring
        timely closing of cases;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procedures for ensuring
        that individual cases are not reported more than once;
        and</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procedures for reviewing
        case information prior to its submission to LSC.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the revised
Handbook contains new, clearer definitions of &quot;case&quot;,
&quot;client&quot;, and &quot;referred after legal
assessment.&quot; The Handbook also contains expanded guidance
on: when to count referrals as cases; when to count repeated
contacts with a client as single or separate cases; and when to
count non-traditional forms of service such as <i>pro</i> <i>se</i>
clinics as cases.</p>

<p><b><u>Applicability to 1998 Cases Reported to LSC in March
1999</u></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The revised CSR Handbook does
not apply to 1998 cases, except that the following two sections <i>do</i>
apply to the submission of 1998 case information to LSC on March
1, 1999:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3.3 - Timely
        Closing of Cases</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3.4 - Management
        Review of Case Service Reports</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the July 1993 version of
the Handbook remains in effect until January 1, 1999, as does LSC
Program Letter 98-3 (May 12, 1998), which requires that programs <i>not</i>
report as 1998 cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases supported solely
        with non-LSC funds;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases in which clients do
        not meet LSC eligibility requirements; and</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases in which the only
        service provided to a client is a referral.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please contact John Meyer, LSC
Program Counsel, at (202) 336-8909 with questions or comments
about the revised CSR Handbook. Thank you for your continuing
efforts to ensure the accuracy and reliability of CSR data.<br>

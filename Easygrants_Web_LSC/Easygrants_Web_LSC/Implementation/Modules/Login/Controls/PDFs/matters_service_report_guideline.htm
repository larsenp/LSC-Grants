  <td>1. Data collection on &quot;matters&quot; handled for individuals
</font>

<p>Several kinds of non-case &quot;matters&quot; are performed for individuals who have
applied for legal assistance to a legal services program or hotline. These include the
following:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b>Referral</b> of an applicant or hotline caller to other agencies or sources of
        assistance;<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Provision of legal education materials</b> in lieu of further legal assistance, e.g.,
        printed brochures, videos, CD-ROMs ;<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Provision of pro se assistance materials,</b> e.g., self-help divorce kits, pro se
        forms, instructions on how to proceed in Small Claims court;<br>
      </li>
      <b>
      <li>Help desk at court.</li>
      </b>
    </ul>
<b>

<p>The overall approach we are proposing is to create a list of &quot;Matters Codes&quot;
to track non-case &quot;matter&quot; categories. </b>All LSC grantees are familiar with
the LSC Legal Problem Codes ranging from 1-99. We have created the LSC Matters Codes
ranging from 101-159. This will allow programs to collect information on matters in
individual cases by providing this one additional field to their case management system
(CMS). With minor modifications, these CMS systems or forms can be used to collect and
tabulate data on completed non-case &quot;matters.&quot;</p>

<b>

<p>Using Matters Codes</p>
</b>

<p>Currently LSC uses legal program codes for areas of law reported on the CSR reports.
The new LSC system to report Matters has six different types of Matters: Community Legal
Education, Pro Se Assistance, Referred, Outreach, Indirect Service, and Other. These six
areas are divided into different areas, called Models.</p>

<p>To help you keep track of the matters you perform, we have developed Matters Codes,
similar to the legal problem codes with which you are familiar. Below is a list of the
codes:</p>

This approach allows you to record the information needed to report to LSC with only
minor modifications to your case management systems. These include:</p>

    <ul typ="disc">
      <li>Addition of a field to record the Matters Code, with a drop-down list of the codes.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Modification of <i>queries</i> to select cases with &quot;Matters Codes&quot; from
      &quot;closed cases&quot;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Development of <i>reports </i>to summarize the matters data by type of matter.
      (Additional reports can be developed to tabulate the data in various ways for local use
      &#151; e.g., cross-tabulations of &quot;referral&quot; categories by legal problem.)<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Appropriate<i> re-labeling of input screens</i> to make the distinction between
      &quot;Closed Cases&quot; and &quot;Completed Matters&quot; clear to the intake staff or
      advocates who are entering the data.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Properly train the staff who to use both the Matters Code and the Legal Problem Code to
      record matters. Since matters must be reported both by totals for Models and for Case
      Type, both numbers are needed. This is why you may not simply add the Matters Codes to the
      Legal Problem Codes.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Add two new Legal Problem Codes to your current list. These two codes will be used with
      referrals. They are 97-Other Problems (non-legal) and 98-Criminal referrals.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">

<p>2. Data collection on &quot;matters&quot; handled in group settings</p>
</font>

<p>These types of matters include the following:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
    <b>
    <li>Legal education workshops and presentations</li>
    <li>Pro se clinics and workshops</li>
    <li>Legal education for lay service providers</li>
    </b>
    </ul>
<b>

<p>Three types of information are required:</p>
</b>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Numbers of people who directly receive the services;</li>
      <li>Narrative overview of the services provided; and</li>
      <li>Vignettes, or &quot;good stories&quot; that can be used to illustrate the results and
      benefits that are achieved as a result of these services.</li>
    </ul>

<p><b>Situation (1): Small numbers of events. </b>If your program does not offer a large
number of these kinds of events each year, this information can be collected very simply.
The staff members responsible for these services can usually draft the narrative
information readily from notes or memory. The numbers can be estimated by consulting the
calendar and writing down all the community presentations made during the year along with
an estimate of the number of people who attended.</p>

<p><b>Situation (2): Large numbers of events.</b> You will need to have a tracking system
in place if you have an ambitious community legal education or pro se assistance program.
This system need not be complex or burdensome. For example, the person responsible for
reporting can ask the people who make presentations or conduct workshops to provide brief
reports, using a simple form provided for this purpose.</p>

<p>This report would capture the following information about each event:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Date of the event, title and name of the person completing the report;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Type of event (community legal education, pro se assistance, etc.)<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Number of participants<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Brief narrative (2-3 sentences) describing the event.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>&quot;Good story&quot; &#151; If the event had especially good results or had an
      especially compelling impact on participants, the presenter can include a brief vignette
      in her report.</li>
    </ul>

<p>These reports can be kept in a &quot;reporting&quot; file and used to tabulate the
numbers of &quot;matters&quot; completed report at the time the matters report is due.</p>

<p>In many instances, procedures are already in place that can be tapped into for
capturing the required information. For example, many pro se clinic projects keep sign-up
sheets or attendance logs capturing data on the number of people attending each session.
All that is needed is a way of summarizing this information for the annual
&quot;matters&quot; report.</p>

<p><b>Some case management systems already have provisions for collecting this
information. </b><i>Kemp&#146;s Clients</i>, for example, has an &quot;Other
Services&quot; input screen for capturing information on community legal education
workshops, pro se clinics or other events that meet the definition of &quot;matters.&quot;
With minor modifications, this system will work for collecting the information needed to
report your matters to LSC. We have worked with Kemps Caseworks so that they will have
information on how to make these changes available on their web site. </p>

<p>Also, we have worked with the <i>Western New York Law Center</i> to be sure they have
time to modify their <i>TIME </i>system so that it can capture the information as well. </p>

<p>These kinds of provisions can be added to most database management programs without
extensive programming. Grantees should consult the people responsible for maintaining
their case management systems to see what would be involved in adding this capacity.</p>

<p><b>Preparations for collecting this information.</b> These consist of three steps: </p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Establishing who is responsible for keeping track of this information,<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Setting up a simple procedure for ensuring the numbers and narratives are recorded and
      fed to the person who prepares the end-of-the-year report, and<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Checking from time to time, including running trial reports, to make sure that the data
      are being captured and that suitable reports can be tabulated at the time they are needed.</li>
    </ul>

<p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
3. Data collection on &quot;matters&quot; representing services provided to the
low-income population as a whole</p>
</font>

<p><Font Face="Times New Roman"> These kinds of matters include the following:</p>

    <b>
    <blockquote>
      *&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal education articles </b>published in newsletters
    <b>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; Client information brochures</b> distributed in client waiting rooms or to local
      agencies
    <b>
    <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; Web site or kiosk postings </b>of legal education or pro se assistance materials
</blockquote>

<p>These require estimates of the total numbers of people directly receiving these
services and narrative descriptions and &quot;good story&quot; vignettes illustrating the
results and benefits of these services on the low-income community.</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li><b>Newsletter articles.</b> We acknowledge that numbers regarding people who receive
      community legal education information from newsletters will be rough approximations at
      best. Still, it is useful to know whether the scale of this service is on the order of 500
      people annually, 5,000 people, or 50,000 people. Without some numerical information it is
      difficult for a stakeholder to appreciate how significant this category is in the overall
      legal education effort of a program.<br>
      <br>
      At the outside, the number of people reached would
      be the number of newsletter copies that are distributed containing legal education
      articles. This information can be obtained from the staff person responsible for program
      newsletters.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Client information brochures.</b> As with newsletter articles, order-of-magnitude
      estimates of the numbers of client information brochures and similar legal education
      materials will provide useful indications of the scale of this service to the low income
      community. At the outside it would be the number of brochures printed each year to replace
      the number that are distributed. The narrative description of this service that you
      provide in your report would indicate the nature and number of different topics covered
      &#151; bankruptcy, wills, truth-in lending, etc.. This information can be obtained from
      the Community Legal Education coordinator in the program.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Web site or kiosk postings. </b> This is another topic for which order-of-magnitude
      estimates are useful but expectations of precision kept modest. &quot;Page hits&quot; is a
      useful measure available to your web master from software mounted on your program&#146;s
      web server or Internet hosting service. Scores of statistics are available from these
      services, but the one that currently seems to make the most sense is the number of
      &quot;page hits&quot; on pages containing the types of information defined as
      &quot;matters&quot; -- community legal education materials, pro se assistance materials or
      outreach (&quot;how to reach us&quot;) information. <p><font face="Times New Roman">Statistical tabulations of page
      hits can be compiled and printed out monthly or quarterly. These can be tabulated by the
      webmaster to cover a year&#146;s time when the annual &quot;matters&quot; report is due.</font></p>

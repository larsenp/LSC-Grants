Checklist -- Form B.</strong></p>

<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="../images/red&amp;blueline.gif" width="587" height="7"></p>

<p>The LSC Grant Application Forms are accessible for all applicants who have submitted
the Notice of Intent to Compete (Form H).&nbsp; To access the grant application forms,
click Grant Applications from the Legal Services Corporation Applicant Information Network
homepage (<a href="http://www.ain.lsc.gov">www.ain.lsc.gov</a>). This will take you to the
Competitive Grant Applications menu. Then select Grant Application Forms and enter the LSC
Applicant ID and the Password you used for submitting the Notice of Intent to Compete
form. </p>

<p>After you have entered your Applicant ID and password, you will access the Grant
Application Forms Menu. Select Checklist - Form B and click 'OK' to continue.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Form B</b></font> </p>

<p>Form B is the Grant Application Checklist and needs to be completed after completion of
the other forms and materials in the grant application package. There are three sections
to Form B: hard-copy documents, electronic documents, and electronic forms. Enter the
numbers of pages of each of the hard-copy documents mailed to LSC. Also enter the numbers
of pages of the <i>electronic</i> documents uploaded to LSC through Form L.</p>

<p>The number of pages for the electronic forms will appear automatically as you submit
each form. If all required documents have been submitted, 'Yes' will appear in the right
column. If 'No' appears, one or more required forms have not been submitted. Because Form
B tracks submission of all other forms, please submit this form after you have submitted
all the other required forms.</p>

<p>To save, exit or submit, use the buttons at the bottom of the screen.</p>

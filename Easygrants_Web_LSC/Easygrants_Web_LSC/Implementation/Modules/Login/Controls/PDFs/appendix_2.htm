    <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a society based on law, justice is available only to
    those who can make the legal system work for them. A right is not a right unless it can be
    enforced; a remedy is not a remedy if it is available only in theory. For the poor, who
    lack the economic resources to hire a lawyer, justice historically has often been
    difficult or impossible to achieve. Lack of economic resources as well as dependence on
    public institutions and programs create a magnitude of legal problems for the poor that
    have been difficult to resolve. <br wp="br1">
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of public funding for entities providing
    legal services to the poor developed in direct response to this overwhelming need.
    Although public funding of civil legal services is a relatively a recent development,
    these institutionalized efforts have become a fundamental part of the American system of
    justice. Their importance is affirmed by the sustained support they have received from
    clients, the organized bar, the judiciary, elected officials and the public. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American Bar Association first adopted Standards for
    the operation of civil legal aid programs in 1961. Those Standards were reviewed and
    revised in 1966, and the Standards currently in effect were approved in 1970. The
    Standards for Civil Legal Aid have not been addressed by the American Bar Association
    since that date. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The past sixteen years have significantly increased the
    understanding of how to meet the legal needs of the poor most effectively, and have
    witnessed both a substantial growth in legal services efforts, and the emergence of a
    variety of delivery modes, involving both staff and private lawyers. These developments
    warrant the promulgation of a new set of Standards to apply to such practice. The
    continued evolvement of systems for providing civil legal aid suggests the need for the
    continuing evolution of Standards to match new understanding. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><u><strong>The Purpose of the Standards</strong></u> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standards are written to serve several purposes.
    Indigent persons should receive legal representation of a quality as high as the client of
    any lawyer. The Standards are designed principally to guide organizations providing such
    civil legal assistance to the poor. Organizations representing the poor are confronted
    with a number of difficult operational and practice issues. The resources available to
    them to meet the legal need of the poor are generally insufficient given the high level of
    demand that exists. Consequently, legal services providers are consistently faced with
    difficult choices regarding how to allocate scarce resources, while striving to assist
    practitioners to meet their professional obligation to their clients. The Standards are
    intended to provide guidance to such organizations by addressing issues that arise in the
    context of the competing demands for high quality legal work, efficiently produced within
    available resources. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standards may serve as a guide for civil legal aid
    organizations which are just being established. They may provide a basis for evaluating
    the effectiveness of legal aid organizations. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>Definitions of Significant Terms Used in the Standards</u></strong> <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal aid organizations are referred to throughout the
    Standards as &quot;legal services providers.&quot; A legal services provider is an
    organization which regularly makes civil legal representation available to the poor
    without charge or at greatly reduced cost. The term does not include a private lawyer or
    law firm that accepts a referral from a legal services provider for representation of a
    client, or when they provide pro bono services. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term &quot;practitioner&quot; as used in the
    Standards refers to an attorney who represents an indigent client under the auspices of a
    legal services provider or to a paralegal, law student, lay advocate or tribal advocate
    who is supervised by an attorney and engages in activities specifically authorized by
    federal, state or tribal law. In such circumstances the attorney is ultimately responsible
    for the work of the non-attorneys being supervised. In those circumstances where an
    activity requires a particular type of practitioner, such as an attorney, the Standards
    and commentary use the more appropriate descriptive term, rather than the term
    &quot;practitioner&quot;. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serving the needs of the poor for civil legal services
    involves the combined efforts of full time staff attorneys devoted to such work, and the
    substantial commitment of private lawyers' time, whether on a compensated or a pro bono
    basis. All such attorneys are included within the term &quot;practitioner&quot; as it is
    used in these Standards. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>Application of the Standards</u></strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Standards focus principally on the responsibilities
    of legal services providers as organizations which serve the civil legal needs of the
    poor. Others address the role of the practitioner who represents an indigent client under
    the aegis of such an organization. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many private lawyers represent poor clients free of
    charge, independent of any legal services organization. Because they are written as a
    guide for representation provided through legal services providers, many Standards are not
    appropriate for such individual efforts. Nevertheless, the Standards, particularly those
    pertaining to the responsibility of individual practitioners, may provide practical
    guidance to effective lawyering by those attorneys. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a wide diversity in the form and organization
    of legal services providers. Some organizations operate principally, or exclusively, to
    provide legal services to the poor. For others, representation of the poor is incidental
    to their central purpose. Many organizations operate with a core of staff attorneys,
    supplemented by components that include the substantial involvement of private attorneys
    working on a volunteer or compensated basis. Some programs which use the volunteer efforts
    of private lawyers are sponsored directly by bar associations, either as an integral part
    of the association or as a free-standing operation. Law school clinical programs provide
    legal services through law students working under the supervision of faculty or private
    attorneys. Some programs are operated by church groups, ethnic societies or charitable
    organizations. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also many different funding sources for legal
    services providers. A majority of providers receive some portion of their funding from the
    Legal Service Corporation, the predominant source of funds for indigent civil legal
    assistance. Funds from this source are governed by a number of specific requirements
    created by statute, regulation, and grant conditions. There are number of legal services
    organizations, however, which receive all or part of their funds from other sources,
    including: Interest on Lawyers' Trust Account (IOLTA) programs; bar associations; private
    philanthropic foundations; community charitable fund raising organizations; federal,
    state, and local governmental agencies; and gifts. Typically, these funding sources impose
    relatively fewer conditions on the expenditure of their funds. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standards are written to provide guidance to all
    organizations providing legal services to the poor, whatever their method of delivery, or
    source of funds. The Standards recognize, however, that the institutional structure and
    funding of the provider will affect whether, or how, a particular Standard might be
    applied. Some Standards will not be appropriate for certain legal services providers for
    legal, practical and institutional reasons. Some bar sponsored pro bono programs, for
    example, would encounter difficulty complying with some of the Standards related to
    governance. Other Standards, pertaining to ongoing involvement with clients, may be
    impractical and unnecessary for some programs and for individual private practitioners who
    participate in a private attorney component of a provider. Where application of a
    particular Standard is not reasonable or is impractical for some types of providers it
    need not be followed. However, the Commentary to the Standard acknowledges the limitation
    and suggests how the provider might seek to serve the underlying principles embraced by
    the Standard by alternative means. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>Use of the Standards</u></strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All lawyers are bound by the ethical standards adopted
    by the appropriate authority in the jurisdiction in which they practice. The ethical
    standards in virtually every state are based in whole or part upon either the Model Rules
    of Professional Conduct or the former Model Code of Professional Responsibility. The
    American Bar Association historically has taken the lead in developing and articulating
    the ethical norms which govern the practice of law. These Standards do not impose any
    different ethical requirements than those already contained in the Model Code of
    Professional Responsibility and the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. In some
    instances, they touch upon issues that are governed by the accepted rules of professional
    conduct, and elucidate their application in the context of the special circumstances of
    providing civil legal services to indigents. In those instances the commentary may make
    appropriate reference to, but does not alter, the controlling ethical requirement. <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All attorneys should review and abide by the appropriate
    rules of conduct which govern practice in their jurisdiction. These Standards do not, and
    are not intended to, provide references to all the Model Rules and Model Code provisions
    which may apply to the representation of any indigent person. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standards are intended only as guidelines. They do
    not create any mandatory requirements for the operation of any legal services provider or
    the actions of any practitioner. Failure to comply with a Standard should not give rise to
    a cause of action, not should it create any presumption that a legal services provider or
    a practitioner has breached any legal duty owed to a client or to a funding source.
    Rather, the Standards represent the current combined and distilled judgement of a number
    of persons who have substantial experience in the area. Their adoption by the American Bar
    Association stands as a recommendation to legal services providers and practitioners
    regarding how they should operate in order to maximize their capacity to provide high
    quality legal services to their clients in the face to scarce resources. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standards themselves are set forth in bold face
    capitalized type. Each Standard is accompanied by extensive commentary to explain or
    illustrate the Standard, or to identify issues that might arise in its application. The
    commentary is not intended to expand any Standard beyond what is stated in the Standard
    itself. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>The Underlying Principles of the Standards</u></strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of essential principles have guided the
    development of these Standards. These principles underlie all of the Standards and are
    basic to civil legal aid practice. Some are also specifically addressed by a separate
    Standard. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High Quality. The Standards are based on the
    competency standard which is stated as a minimum in the Model Rules of Professional
    Conduct (Rule 1.1) and the Model Code of Professional Responsibility (DR6-101). They are
    also based on the belief that all practitioners should strive to provide representation of
    the highest possible quality, and therefore, they address issues of practitioner
    qualifications and training, supervision systems that support quality, specific quality
    assurance control mechanisms, and the fundamental elements of effective representation. <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zealous Representation of Client Interests. All
    lawyers have an ethical responsibility to pursue their clients' interests zealously within
    the confines of the law and applicable standards of professional conduct. This has
    particular implications for legal services providers which represent the poor. <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When effective resolution of individual clients'
    problems is circumscribed by existing laws and practices, or when existing law and
    practices result in the same or similar problems for many indigent clients, representation
    of a client may call for a practitioner to reach beyond the individual problem to
    challenge the law, policy or practice. The fact that such advocacy may be complex,
    difficult, or controversial should not be a barrier to a practitioner pursuing it.
    Furthermore, the range of legal problems that confront a provider's clients and the
    generally limited resources available to it to respond may call for a provider and its
    practitioners to use a variety of representational modes and innovative lawyering on
    behalf of clients. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client Participation in the Representation. In all
    legal representation, clients should decide the objectives sought by the representation,
    within the limits imposed by law and the practitioner's ethical obligations, and should be
    consulted in determining the means used to pursue those objectives. (See Model Rules of
    Professional Conduct, Rule 1.2(c); Model Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 7-101.)
    Particularly in the representation of low-income clients, there is great potential for
    developing an unequal relationship between the client and practitioner. The Standards
    recognize this reality and emphasize the need for specific efforts at every stage of
    representation to assure that practitioners communicate with their clients consistent with
    ethical requirements. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsiveness to the Needs of Clients. Legal services
    providers represent the principal organized effort to respond to the civil legal needs of
    the poor. Typically, their resources are extremely limited in the face of overwhelming
    need. Providers, therefore, have an acute responsibility to assure that those resources
    are utilized in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of their legal work and is
    responsive to the most pressing client needs. Generally, not all clients can be
    represented, and not all legal problems can be addressed. Frequently, as well, a choice
    must be made regarding whether the commitment of substantial funds and attorney time to a
    potentially costly representation is prudent or even possible given the limitations
    imposed by severely limited resources. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standards seek to give guidance regarding the
    factors which are appropriate to consider in making such difficult choices. Prioritization
    of legal problems in terms of their importance to clients is acknowledged as one
    legitimate factor to be considered among others. The Standards recognize that determining
    which matters are most significant to clients is a task fraught with difficulty.
    Accordingly, the commentary to various Standards suggest a number of ways for a provider
    to seek input from the eligible client population regarding which problems are perceived
    by them to be most critical. In addition, providers are urged to consult with
    participating private attorneys, with the bar generally, and with agencies dealing with
    the poor. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, various policies regarding provider operation
    and delivery structure will affect its capacity to serve its clients effectively. The
    Standards espouse the principle that guidance from the clients to be served will assist
    the provider to make intelligent decisions about such matters. <br wp="br1">

<p>You can select either Form F-1 or Form F-2 and proceed. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Scrolling Forms:</b></font> Some forms are larger than a
single screen will contain and have a scroll bar along the right-hand margin of the screen
to enable you to see the rest of the form. Clicking on the scroll bar will enable you to
scroll down through a form. You may also use the Page-Down and Down-Arrow keys to scroll
down through a form. Similarly, you may use the scroll bar or Page-Up and Up-Arrow keys to
scroll back up through any form. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Entering Data:</b></font> Each form has certain information
pre-filled, including your organization's name and LSC Applicant ID. Each form will
contain cells for entering the necessary data. To enter, click on the cell and type in the
information. You may also use the Tab key to move to the next cell in a form. Pressing the
Shift and Tab keys simultaneously will enable you to move to the previous cell. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Numeric Data: </b></font>Some forms require entry of numeric
information. These forms will not work properly with non-numeric data such as commas or
spaces. <b><i>Please do not enter commas or periods in numeric data, or leave a cell blank
instead of entering zero.</i></b> Entering commas, periods or any non-numeric data will
cause an error message while saving. The system will not allow you to save such data. If
one or more cells are blank, the Total row at the end of the form will display
&quot;NaN&quot; which means that one or more cells contain a non-numeric value. You will
not be able to submit a form with NaN and need to correct the problem before submitting. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Saving Data /Exiting Forms:</b></font> Each form has buttons
at the bottom for Saving and Exiting. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Printing Forms: </b></font>You can use your browser to print
the form that you are working on. Click on the print icon at the top of the screen when
you are ready to print and click on OK to print. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Submitting Forms:</b></font> Once you are certain that a form
on which you have been working is complete, you may submit it to LSC by clicking on the
SUBMIT button. <b><i>Please do not press the SUBMIT button unless you are certain that you
no longer wish to work on the form.</i></b> After you have submitted a form to LSC, you
will be unable to access it without calling LSC to ask that we un-submit the form. </p>

<p align="left">All eligible persons, groups and entities must have a governing or policy
body consistent with the requirements of 45 C.F.R. Part 1607 of the LSC Regulations. This
regulation is designed to ensure that the governing or policy body of a recipient of LSC
funds is well qualified to guide a recipient in efforts to provide high quality legal
assistance and to ensure that the recipient is accountable to its clients. </p>

<p align="left">The regulation defines governing and policy bodies separately. A governing
body is a board of directors or other body with authority to govern the activities of a
recipient receiving funds under Section 1006(a)(1)(A) of the LSC Act of 1974. A policy
body is a policy board or other body established by a recipient to formulate and enforce
policy with respect to the services provided under a grant or contract made under the Act.
For a policy body to comply with the regulations, it must be approved by the Corporation
through a waiver of the governing body regulations. </p>

<p align="left">Applicants without a governing or policy body that complies with 45 C.F.R.
Part 1607 must submit a plan for establishing a governing/policy body that complies with
the LSC requirements. The applicant's governing/policy body plan should be submitted along
with the proposal. For those applicants, submission of this plan shall be deemed
submission of a waiver request under 45 C.F.R. Part 1607, and shall be subject to approval
by LSC. All applicants must have a governing/policy body, that complies with 45 C.F.R.
Part 1607, within 60 days of the date of the grant award. The general requirements for a
governing /policy body follow. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li><p align="left">The majority of the members of the governing/policy body shall be
        attorney members appointed by the governing body(ies) of one or more State, county or
        municipal bar associations, the membership of which represents a majority of attorneys
        practicing law in the localities in which the applicant provides legal assistance. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left">At least sixty percent (60 %) of the members of the body are attorneys. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left">At least one-third (33.3%) of the members of the body were eligible to
        receive free legal services at the time of their appointment to the body. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p align="left">Appointments shall be made so as to insure that the governing/policy
        body reasonably reflects the interests of the eligible clients, the diversity of the legal
        community and the population of the areas served including race, ethnicity, gender and
        other similar factors. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I. Applicants that currently do not have a governing/policy body</strong> that
  conforms to the requirements of 45 C.F.R. Part 1607 should enter zero for each category on
  Form F-1 and must submit a plan for developing its governing/policy body. The applicant's
  governing/policy body plan should be submitted along with the proposal. Limit the
  governing/policy body plan to three double-space type written pages. Applicants are
  encouraged to thoroughly review 45 C.F.R. Part 1607 before preparing this plan. The
  governing/policy body plan should minimally address:</p>
  <p>a. the total number of governing/policy body members that will be on the board; </p>
  <p>b. the membership of the governing/policy body; (i.e., the number of attorneys
  appointed by bar associations, the number of other attorney governing/policy body members,
  the number of client governing/policy body members, and &quot;other&quot; governing/policy
  body members appointed to assure that the body as a whole reasonably reflects the
  diversity of the areas served); </p>
  <p>c. how the governing/policy body will be established, (including identification of the
  bar association(s) that will appoint a majority of the governing/policy body members, and
  the steps that will be taken to assure ethnic and gender diversity) and; </p>
  <p>d. the client organizations that the applicant anticipates will appoint income-eligible
  members for the governing/policy body. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>II. If the applicant currently has a governing/policy body</strong> that

  <p>Applicants who currently have a governing/policy body should also complete Form F-2
  which details the individual board member information.</p>

  edit board member information, click on the 'Update' button at the end of the screen. The
  next screen will show you the list of all board members. Highlight the one you want to

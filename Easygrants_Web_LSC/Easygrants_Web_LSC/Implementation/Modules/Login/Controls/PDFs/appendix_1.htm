    and targeting <br>
    &nbsp; resources on the most pressing legal needs of the low income community.</font></strong>
    </p>
      <hr>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Performance Criteria acknowledge the central
    importance of strategic planning, and envision a dynamic model in which such planning is
    followed by and interwoven with implementation and evaluation, constantly adjusting
    objectives and strategies to better address the most critical legal needs of a low-income
    community. While much of a Legal Services program's work is necessarily reactive,
    responding to major changes affecting the low-income population, it is important that such
    reaction occur within a well thought-out framework, designed to enable the program to be
    as effective as possible in staying focused upon and addressing the most pressing needs of
    the low-income community it serves. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be emphasized that this performance area
    does not require one particular form or method of assessment, such as written surveys, nor
    does it require extensive documentation of the planning process. Rather, the program
    should be able to demonstrate that it has, through whatever approaches it uses, come to a
    reasoned, thorough assessment of its client community's most pressing legal needs. Based
    on this assessment, the program should set out clearly how it is trying to address the
    identified needs. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Criteria</strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. <u>Periodic comprehensive assessment</u>.</strong> The program periodically
    undertakes a comprehensive assessment of the most pressing legal problems and needs, both
    addressed and unaddressed, of the low-income population in its service area, including all
    major subgroups. These comprehensive assessments should be made frequently enough, in the
    light of their cost, to be reasonably calculated to identify new developments and
    opportunities affecting that population. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. <u>Ongoing consideration of needs</u>.</strong> The program is flexible and
    responsive enough to recognize and adjust to major new needs of its target population that
    emerge or develop in between the periodic, in-depth assessments described in Criterion
    One. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. <u>Setting priorities and allocating resources</u>.</strong> In the light of
    its comprehensive and ongoing assessment of need, and its available resources, the program
    periodically sets explicit goals, priorities and objectives. Insofar as possible, these
    priorities and objectives should be expressed in terms of desired outcomes for the client
    community, and should articulate the general types of services which the program will
    provide and the kinds of cases or matters which will and will not be accepted. The program
    should then target its resources consistent with these goals, priorities, and objectives.
    To the extent that pressing needs have been identified which the program will not be able
    to address directly because of resource limitations, the program should consider other
    methods that might be employed to provide some assistance to affected clients. <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. <u>Implementation</u>.</strong> The program then implements these priorities
    and works toward the desired outcomes, by considering, adopting and implementing
    comprehensive strategies which make use of available and appropriate approaches for legal
    representation, advocacy, and other program work. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>5. <u>Evaluation and adjustment</u>.</strong> The program, in conjunction with
    the community that it serves, analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of its work, in
    major part by comparing the results actually achieved with the outcomes originally
    intended, and then utilizes this analysis and evaluation to make appropriate changes as
    the program carries out future assessments and develops subsequent priorities, objectives,
    and strategies. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
      <hr>
    <p><strong><font color="blue">&nbsp; PERFORMANCE AREA TWO: Effectiveness in engaging and
    serving<br>
    &nbsp; the client community.</font></strong> </p>
      <hr>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A program must have effective relations with its
    clients, on both an individual and community-wide basis. Although the centrality of client
    relations and engagement is explicit or implicit throughout the criteria, this Performance
    Area sets forth the central values. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Criteria</strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. <u>Dignity and sensitivity</u>.</strong> The program conducts its work in a
    way that affirms and reinforces the dignity of clients, is sensitive to clients'
    individual circumstances and is responsive to each client's legal problems. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. <u>Engagement in the client community</u>.</strong> The program is in close
    touch with the community eligible for its services, and effectively engages that community
    in all appropriate aspects of its operations. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. <u>Access and utilization by the community</u>.</strong> Once a program's
    priorities and objectives are defined, the program should, over time and within the limits
    of its resources and program priorities, be accessible to and facilitate effective
    utilization by the low-income population in its service area, including all major
    subgroups of that population, and all categories of people who traditionally have had
    difficulties in getting access to or utilizing Legal Services programs. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
      <hr>
    <p><strong><font color="blue">&nbsp; PERFORMANCE AREA THREE: Effectiveness of legal
    representation and other<br>
    &nbsp; program activities intended to benefit the low-income population in its service
    area.</font></strong> </p>
      <hr>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Area Three addresses the program's implementation
    of its plans, priorities, and objectives. Of primary importance is Criterion 1, Legal
    representation, to which Legal Services programs allocate the greatest amount of
    resources. The fundamental question is whether the program is doing good legal work.
    Criterion 1 relies on the ABA Standards for Providers of Civil Legal Services to the Poor,
    which include in the referenced sections considerable detail concerning legal
    representation. The later criteria address other major areas of program activities. <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Criteria</strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. <u>Legal representation</u>.</strong> The program conducts its direct legal
    representation so that it comports with the relevant provisions of professional ethics,
    the ABA Standards for Providers or Civil Legal Services to the Poor, and other accepted
    guidelines applicable to the provision of legal assistance to low-income people.
      <ul>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The program has in place adequate capacity and resources to carry out its work, insofar
          as its resources permit. <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
        </li>
        <li>The program utilizes systems, approaches, and techniques sufficient to insure the
          representation is carried out with maximum effectiveness. <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
        </li>
        <li>Taken as a whole, the program's legal representation achieves as much as is reasonably
          attainable for the client, given the client's objectives and all the circumstances of the
          case. In addition, consistent with applicable rules and decisions governing professional
          responsibility, in its representation the program also achieves as much as reasonably
          possible for other low-income people similarly situated, and for the eligible population
          as a whole, commensurate with program priorities and objectives.</li>
      </ol>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Criterion 2. <u>Other program services to the eligible client population</u>. </strong>To
    the extent such efforts further program priorities and objectives, the program provides
    other services which enable clients to address their legal needs and problems. Such
    services my include, but are not limited to, community legal education, telephone advice
    and hotlines, facilitation of self-help activities and <u>pro</u> <u>se</u> appearances,
    utilization of alternative dispute resolution, and other activities. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>Criterion 3. <u>Other program activities on behalf of the eligible client
    population</u>. </strong>Consistent with its priorities and objectives, and within the
    limits of available resources and the terms of its funding, a program pursues other
    activities on behalf of its eligible client community which have a beneficial effect on
    systemic legal problems of the eligible client population, and also maintains
    communication with the judiciary, organized bar, government agencies, academic and
    research centers and other information sources, state and national Legal Services support
    centers and other organizations working on behalf of low-income people, and other entities
    whose activities have a significant effect on the eligible client population. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
      <hr>
    <p><strong><font color="blue">&nbsp; PERFORMANCE AREA FOUR: Effectiveness of
    administration and <br>
    &nbsp; governance.</font></strong> </p>
      <hr>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The program should be led and managed effectively,
    with high quality administrative systems and procedures. While not a guarantee of
    effective services to clients, good leadership and strong internal operations increase the
    likelihood of such effective services, and decrease the risk that previously effective
    program services will be undermined by organizational problems. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Area addresses program administration, apart
    from the systems related to legal representation and other program services activities
    which are covered in Performance Area Three. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Criteria</strong> <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. <u>Basic administration</u>.</strong> The program maintains an effective
    management structure; has in place effective administrative procedures and personnel;
    allocates appropriate resources to management functions; and carries out periodic
    evaluations of administrative operations. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. <u>Board governance</u>.</strong> The program has effective board oversight
    and involvement in major policy decisions, consistent with Standards 7.1 through 7.3. <br
    wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. <u>Financial administration</u>.</strong> The program has and follows
    financial policies, procedures and practices which comport with applicable requirements of
    the AICPA, OMB, and the program's funding sources, and conducts effective budget planning
    and oversight. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. <u>Personnel administration</u>.</strong> The program maintains effective
    personnel administration. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>5. <u>Internal communication</u>.</strong> The program maintains effective
    intra-staff and staff-management communications and relations that enhance service
    delivery. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>6. <u>General resource development and maintenance</u>.</strong> To the extent
    possible, and consistent with the program's mission, the program maintains and expands its
    base of funding, with a goal of increasing the quality and quantity of the program's
    services to eligible clients. The program also coordinates with and where possible
    utilizes outside resources such as academic institutions, social service organizations,
    foundations, corporations, and other institutions and individuals to increase the
    community's overall resources devoted to the legal problems and needs of the eligible
    client population. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p><strong>7. <u>Coherent and comprehensive delivery structure</u>. </strong>Overall, the
    program maintains a delivery structure and approach which effectively utilizes and
    integrates staff, private attorneys, and other components, is well-suited to meeting the
    most pressing legal needs of the service area, comports with Standards 6.2 and 6.3, and
    given available resources constitutes an effective and economical balancing of
    expenditures on the various functions and activities described in the four Performance
    Areas.</td>

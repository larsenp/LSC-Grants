Services Corporation Applicant Information Network homepage (<a href="http://www.ain.lsc.gov"><font color="#0000FF">www.ain.lsc.gov</font></a>). This

<p><font size="4"><b>Preparation of File to Upload</b></font> </p>

<p>Instructions for preparation of the Proposal Narrative 
appear in Section IX of the Request for Proposals. Section IX of the Request for 
Proposals specifies what information should be included in the Proposal 
Narrative. Section VIII of the Request for Proposals also specifies that certain 
attachments should be included with the Proposal Narrative, such as the resumes 
of key staff and a list of references. Please refer to the Request for Proposals 
when preparing the Proposal Narrative and attachments. These instructions 
describe the process for uploading the Proposal Narrative and attachments to LSC 
through the use of Form L.</p>
<b><i>

<p>The file upload process (Form L) permits the uploading 
of a single file only.</i></b> All information to be transmitted to LSC through 
the file upload process must be included in the single file. This includes the 
Proposal Narrative and any attachments such as subgrant information (see the RFP Narrative Instruction), the resumes of key applicant 
staff, and a list of references. Please ensure that all necessary information is 
contained in the file before starting the upload process. </P>

<p><font size="4"><b>Uploading the File - Form L</b></font> </p>

<p>The file upload process involves two steps process for 
uploading a file to LSC. The first step is to locate the file to upload; the 
second step is to submit it to LSC. This process will work only if: (1) the file 
you want to upload is accessible by a computer connected to the Internet, and 
(2) the file is in one of two formats<SPAN class=907025716-25042000><FONT 
color=#000000 face=Arial size=3> 
 </FONT></SPAN>with the appropriate file extension<SPAN class=907025716-25042000><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial 
size=3>:</FONT></SPAN>  (i)&nbsp; .doc 
- Microsoft Word&nbsp; (ii) .wpd - WordPerfect&nbsp; for Windows. </p>

<p>The first step is to locate the file you want to upload. 
From the Grant Application Forms Menu, click Narrative Upload - Form L and then 
click OK. You will see a menu that contains these instructions and the item 
called Application Narrative - Form L. Click on Application Narrative, then 
click OK to access the upload process</p>

<p>You will see a screen that has a Browse button and a 
box containing the name of the file to upload. You can either type the name of 
the file to upload (including the complete path to the file), or you can click 
the Browse button to locate the file. Clicking the Browse button is usually the 
easier and more reliable way to locate the file.</p>

        <p>Once you've located the file to upload, check to be sure 
it has either a .doc or .wpd. Then, click Submit to upload the 
file. If the file upload is successful, you will see a message indicating that 
the upload was successful. When you return to the Grant Application Forms Menu, 
the word 'Submitted' will appear in red next to Narrative Upload - Form L.</p>

<p>If the file upload was not successful, you will see a 
message describing the reason(s) the upload was not successful. Please note the 
explanatory message and try the upload again.</p>

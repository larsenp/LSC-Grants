Background</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LSC and grantee staff have recognized for some time that data obtained through the
existing case service reporting system does not provide a complete picture of the work
programs do for clients; nor does it provide a meaningful picture of the impact which
federal funding has on the delivery of legal services to eligible clients. In particular,
the existing system has three principal shortcomings. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First, the existing system does not capture information about services, such as community
legal education, which do not meet LSC’s definition of a case, and therefore cannot
be reported within the existing system. Because the existing system does not capture these
types of services, it tends to under-report the true volume of work which programs do for
clients.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Second, the existing system captures information only about instances in which programs
are <i>able</i> to provide assistance. It does capture information about the extent to
which programs are <i>un</i>able to meet the demand for their services. For example, the
existing system does not capture information about how many potential clients programs
must turn away because of limited resources.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Third, the existing system does not capture information about the <i>results</i> of
programs’ work, such as benefits to clients. This third shortcoming is especially
noteworthy given the Corporation’s decision to adhere to the Government Performance
and Results Act, which shifts emphasis in performance measurement from
"outputs", such as counting cases, to "outcomes", such as benefits to
clients. </font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Purpose of Information Survey</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recognizing these shortcomings in the existing system, LSC staff decided to conduct a
survey of LSC grantee programs in order to take stock of existing practices for tracking
information (other than counting cases). Many programs, for example, have other sources of
funding which require measurement of outcomes. Similarly, some programs keep track of
eligible applicants who are turned away, or of numbers of people attending community legal
education and outreach events. Knowledge of existing practices in these areas would be
very helpful to future discussions at LSC about the development of a new information
system, as well as help to ensure that any steps taken by LSC would be consistent with
steps taken by other funding sources.</font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Timing and Scope of Survey</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LSC distributed an Information Survey to the field on July 26, 1999, and received 183
responses approximately two months later. The number of programs responding represents a
little over 70 percent of the total number of programs receiving funding from LSC in 1999.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Information Survey specifically asked programs to provide information about their
current practices, including the tracking of information about:</font></p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0" width="85%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="8%">a.</td>
    <td width="85%"><font size="3">applicants not being served because of resource
    limitations;</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="8%">b.</td>
    <td width="85%"><font size="3">applicants receiving assistance other than
    "legal" assistance;</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="8%">c.</td>
    <td width="85%"><font size="3">types of assistance provided (other than "legal"
    assistance);</font></td>

    <td width="85%"><font size="3">case outcomes or benefits obtained for clients; and</font></td>

    <td width="85%"><font size="3">the effect of resource limitations on priority setting and
    case acceptance practices.</font></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center></div>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where available, the Information Survey also asked programs to provide actual data in
these areas for the first six months of the current calendar year (January – June,
1999).</font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Unmet Legal Needs</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the 183 programs responding to the survey, 116 (or nearly 2 out of 3) indicated that
they have recently conducted or participated in an assessment of legal needs in their
service area. The vast majority of these assessments occurred in the past three years, and
nearly half (52) of the assessments surveyed persons living in poverty who were <i>not</i>
program clients. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Program estimates of the amount of unmet legal needs in their service areas varied widely,
from 20 percent or less in a dozen service areas, to 90 percent or more in twenty service
areas. Most frequently, the estimates of unmet legal needs ranged between 75 percent and
85 percent of total legal needs.</font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Applicants Turned Away</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the 183 programs responding to the survey, 38 (approximately 1 out of 5 programs)
indicated that they are able to provide some form of assistance (either legal or
non-legal) to all eligible applicants who seek it. However, as discussed later in this
report, in many instances the assistance received by clients is not sufficient to achieve
resolution of their legal problems.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The vast majority of programs (146, or 4 out of 5) indicated that they are unable, because
of resource limitations, to assist every eligible applicant seeking assistance with a
legal problem within program priorities. Of these 146 programs, 48 indicated that they
keep track of eligible applicants turned away, either through paper records or through the
entry of information into a computer database. These programs reported having turned away
from fewer than 100 to several thousand eligible applicants who sought assistance <i>within
program priorities</i> in the first six months of 1999.</font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Problems Excluded through Priority Setting and Case
Acceptance</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Information Survey also sought to determine whether programs had set priorities which
excluded certain types of legal problems, or whether programs’ case acceptance
practices tended to exclude certain types of legal problems on a regular basis. Of the 183
programs responding to the survey, 159 (or nearly 9 out of 10) reported that they excluded
one or more common types of legal problems, either through the setting of priorities, or
through their case acceptance practices. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The most common types of legal problems excluded by these programs are (with the numbers
of programs excluding these types of legal problems):</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Levels of Service Provided</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the recent emphasis on providing brief counsel and advice through centralized intake
systems and other innovative techniques, many programs have increased the number of
clients they serve. However, not all clients are receiving a level of assistance which is
likely to be sufficient to achieve resolution of their legal problems. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the 183 programs responding to the Information Survey, 132 (or nearly 3 out of 4)
indicated that they are able to provide only "non-legal" assistance to some
clients, where "non-legal" assistance is the provision of information or a
referral without counsel and advice or another form of <i>legal</i> assistance from an
attorney or paralegal. These programs indicated that the number of persons receiving only
"non-legal" assistance generally ranged between 33% and 75% of eligible
applicants. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, 164 of the 183 programs responding to the Information Survey indicated that a
large percentage of their clients are receiving only limited assistance, when their legal
problems would really require a greater amount of assistance to achieve resolution.<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> &nbsp; These programs indicated that the
number of clients receiving limited assistance (when their legal problem required more to
achieve resolution) generally ranged from between 20% and 50% of the total number of
clients receiving limited service. </font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Types of Assistance Provided</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because the existing CSR system does not capture information about services not meeting
LSC’s definition of a case, the Information Survey sought to identify other types of
services which would be suitable for measurement. Information about these types of
services would serve to illuminate subsequent discussions about which of these types of
services, if any, a new information system should endeavor to capture data.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the 183 programs responding to the survey, all indicated that they provide services
other than case representation to clients. The types of services include (with the numbers
of programs providing the services):</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Outcomes (or Benefits for Clients)</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires federal agencies to measure
outcomes resulting from their activities. Having opted to adhere to GPRA, LSC must now
consider moving from measuring "outputs" (such as cases) to measuring
"outcomes" (such as benefits for clients). Because many LSC grantees receive
funding from other funding sources which require outcome measurement, many grantees have
already moved in the direction which GPRA contemplates.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the 183 programs responding to the Information Survey, 107 (or nearly 6 out of 10)
indicated that they currently receive funding from another source which requires
measurement of outcomes. The United Way was mentioned by 48 programs, IOLTA sources were
mentioned by 32 programs, and Federal sources other then LSC were mentioned by 30 programs
as requiring information about case outcomes.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to outcome measurement required by other funding sources, the Information
Survey asked programs to indicate to what extent they consider client satisfaction. Of the
183 programs responding, 141 (or 3 out of 4) indicated that they inquire about client
satisfaction on at least a periodic or sample basis. Of these programs, 41 indicated that
they inquire about client satisfaction in all cases, and the remainder do so for a subset
of their cases.</font></p>
<b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Conclusions</font></p>
</b>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The responses to the Information Survey indicate that many LSC programs currently possess
data on unmet legal needs, and a majority of programs are already collecting and
maintaining at least some information about case outcomes (or benefits to clients). Also,
nearly all programs can readily describe the types of services they provide other than
cases, although relatively few programs keep track of these services in a systemic
fashion.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Given LSC’s determination to adhere to the Government Performance and Results Act,
and the consequent need to be able to report data other than numbers of cases closed, the
next steps are to evaluate the relative benefits and costs of collecting, on a regular
basis, information about unmet legal needs, services provided to clients other than
through cases, and case outcomes (or benefits to clients).</font></p>

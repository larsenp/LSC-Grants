<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have recently found that two
programs have been misunderstanding the CSR closing codes and,
consequently, incorrectly classifying and counting LSC cases.
Correct classification and reporting of all LSC-supported cases
is very important for measuring each program's service to its own
clients and our national program's service to all our clients. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to maintain the
quality of this critical information, we are sending the attached
July 1993 Case Service Report Instruction Handbook to all
programs. We ask that each of you review it carefully. Please pay
close attention to the definition of each case closing code and
review your program's internal CSR instructions and practices to
make certain they conform with the definitions in this Handbook.
We further request that you ensure that each of your branch
offices has a copy of this Handbook. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would also like to remind
you that programs should take care not to count as CSR cases any
cases that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(1) are restricted case types under either the LSC Act or
    our current appropriations act, Public Law 105-119; (2) are
    for clients who do not meet your program's LSC income and
    asset eligibility criteria adopted pursuant to 45 CFR 1611;<a
    href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a><strong> </strong>(3)
    are referrals to others of cases falling into categories 1
    and 2 above;<a href="#sup2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a><strong>
    </strong>or (4) are wholly funded with non-LSC funds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that the reference
to the Program Support and Technical Assistance Division (PSTAD)
on Page 3 of the CSR Handbook is outdated. If you have any
questions about the definitions in the Handbook or their
application to case closing situations you encounter, or if you
need any further information, please contact John Meyer at (202)
336-8909.</p>

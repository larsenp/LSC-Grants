<br>
<font size="5" face="Arial Narrow">&quot;<font color="#800000">Creating Client-Centered State Communities of
Justice&quot;</font></font></p>
</b>
<p>During December of 2000 and January of 2001, LSC sent mailings to LSC-funded
program Executive Directors and state planning contact people throughout the
country regarding an upcoming LSC-sponsored conference entitled &quot;Creating
Client-Centered State Communities of Justice&quot; to be held in April, 2001. We
plan to bring together active client/community advocates and legal services
staff who embrace the concept of &quot;client-centered legal services&quot; and
provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, thoughts, plans and strategies about
how the legal services community can center its work in terms of what empowers,
strengthens and enhances the lives of our clients.</p>
<b>
<p>Meeting Logistics</p>
</b>
<p>The conference will be held at the beautiful and historic Hotel Hershey in
Hershey, Pennsylvania (near Harrisburg) from Wednesday, April 25 through
Saturday, April 28, 2001. Hershey is located 15 miles from Harrisburg
International Airport and within easy driving distance from several major
eastern U.S. cities.</p>
<u>
<p>Participant Selection</p>
</u>
<p>This will be a working conference where active participation by all conferees
will be necessary. Attendance will be limited and participation will be
determined through a competitive process. A combined total of 50 active
client/community advocates and legal services staff who are exemplars of the
concept of &quot;client-centered legal services&quot; will be invited to attend.</p>
<p>Conference participants will be selected by a committee composed of LSC staff
and the two client members of the LSC Board of Directors from nominees submitted
by the state planning leaders in each state. Each state planning council or
governing group has been asked to solicit and endorse applications from 2 or 3
applicants within their state. The deadline for submitting nominations was
Wednesday, January 17.</p>
<u>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
</u>
<p>We are continuing to ask for papers from the field programs and state
communities of justice. We are looking for papers which may be shared with the
conferees and/or serve as the basis for workshops to be conducted. The program
consists of four divisions: Defining the Concept of Client-Centered Legal
Services, Establishing Client-Centered Priorities, Client-Centered Delivery of
Services and Creating Client-Centered State Communities of Justice. We are
requesting that papers have as their main focus one of these broad topics while
also discussing the components as detailed in the &quot;Draft Agenda&quot;
section of the conference announcement which was previously sent.</p>
<p>Full details regarding the criteria for submitting papers is included on the
enclosed &quot;Call for Papers&quot; document in the previous mailing. Papers
must be submitted by February 21, 2001.</p>

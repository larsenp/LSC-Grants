<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 12, 1998, the
Corporation issued Program Letter 98-1 calling upon all LSC
recipients to participate in a state planning process to examine,
from a statewide perspective, what steps should be taken in their
states to further develop a comprehensive, integrated statewide
delivery system. The Letter poses seven questions recipients are
to address in their planning processes and requests recipients to
submit a report to LSC on or before October 1, 1998. Many
recipients have asked LSC to provide further guidance and
additional information about how the state planning process will
affect LSC grant decisions. Recipients have also inquired about
the format for the October 1 report. This Program Letter responds
to these requests. </p>

<p><strong>State Planning Considerations</strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attached <em>State Planning
Considerations </em>have been developed to provide recipients and
other stakeholders with more information about statewide goals,
capacities and approaches recipients should consider in their
planning processes. A number of other sources of information that
may assist state planners and upon which these <em>Considerations</em>
draw are referenced in the <em>Planning Considerations</em>. We
hope these Planning Considerations will help states develop
effective plans to strengthen their delivery systems and services
to clients. We encourage recipients with any questions about the <em>State
Planning Considerations</em> or planning process to contact the
LSC staff member responsible for their state. </p>

<p><strong>How the State Planning Process Will Affect LSC Grant
Decisions</strong> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation is directed
under the LSC Act to &quot;insure that grants and contracts are
made so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery
of legal assistance to persons in both urban and rural
areas.&quot;<a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a>.
The state planning process will provide information that helps
LSC exercise this statutory responsibility. </p>

<p><strong>1. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Competition
</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>a. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Duration
    of grants </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The state planning process will provide information that
    helps LSC determine the duration of grants for service areas
    in the 1999 competition, i.e., service areas that are
    eligible for grants of up to three years commencing January
    1, 1999. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the 1998 LSC grant competition, we determined that
    grants in several states that were eligible for three year
    funding would be made for a shorter period. The decision to
    award grants for a shorter period was made for two reasons:
    (1) to encourage recipients in these states to develop
    further their plans for a comprehensive, integrated statewide
    delivery system; and (2) concern that the configuration of
    LSC-funded programs in these states did not constitute the
    most economical and effective structure for delivering legal
    services to the low-income community. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As with the 1998 competition, LSC will take into account
    state delivery plans and configuration of programs in
    determining the duration of grants for service areas now
    being competed. Where LSC believes states need to further
    develop their plans for a comprehensive, integrated statewide
    delivery system or where LSC remains concerned about the
    configuration of LSC-funded service areas, grants will be
    made for less than three years. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>b. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Service
    areas</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1999
        Competition</strong> </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The state planning process will <em>not</em> affect
        decisions about the number, size or configuration of
        service areas in competition this year. </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>2000
        and Future Competition Years </strong></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Information received through the planning process will
        affect future decisions regarding the most appropriate
        number, size and configuration of LSC-funded service
        areas to be competed for the year 2000 and beyond. This
        includes service areas that become scheduled for those
        years because of one or two year grant awards made in the
        present 1999 competition. </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Grant
Renewals</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The state planning process will <em>not</em> affect
    decisions about the number, size or configuration of service
    areas up for renewal <em>or</em> the duration of grant
    renewals, i.e., previously made multi-year awards which are
    now up for renewal. Decisions on renewal of these grants will
    continue to be based upon a showing of the renewal
    applicant's continued ability &quot;to perform the duties
    required under the terms of its grant.&quot;<a href="#sup2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Format for the October 1 Report </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attached <a
href="pgltr_6A.htm"><i>Instructions for State Planning Reports</i></a>
provide information about the structure and format of the reports
due at LSC on or before October 1, 1998. Please contact the LSC
staff member responsible for your state if you have any
questions.</p>

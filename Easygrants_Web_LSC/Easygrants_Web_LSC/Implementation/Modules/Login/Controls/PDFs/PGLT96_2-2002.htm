<p>As you know, Public Law 104-134, signed into law on April 26, 1996, has provisions
which require recipients to take certain affirmative steps with regard to priorities.</font><font
size="1"><a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> </font><font SIZE="3">We are
writing to advise you of what you should do to implement the priority setting
requirements. We are also sending you a list of suggested priorities promulgated by the
LSC Board on May 20, 1996 for consideration in your priority setting.</p>
<b>

<p>What is Required by Sec. 504 </b>(a) (9).</p>

<p>We want to draw your attention to four aspects of the priorities provisions which go
beyond previous requirements: 

<ul>
  <li>your priorities must be written and specific as to the types of cases and matters and
    must encompass all of the cases and matters, including those undertaken with non-LSC
    funds, to which the program will devote its time and resources;<br>
  </li>
  <li>you must have a written definition of an emergency situation and a written procedure for
    addressing the emergency;&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li>your casehandlers must sign a written agreement that they will not undertake cases or
    matters other than those set as priorities by the Board except for emergency cases or
    matters as defined by your Board;<br>
  </li>
  <li>your program must report information to its Board quarterly and to LSC annually on all
    cases or matters, including emergencies, undertaken that were not in accordance with the
    priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Priorities must still be set in compliance with the LSC Act (Section 1007 (a)(2)(C)(i))
which requires consideration of the relative needs of eligible clients for assistance,
including outreach training and support services, particularly the needs of clients with
special difficulties of access to legal services or with special legal problems. Please
note that the LSC Board of Directors anticipates adopting an interim revised regulation
governing priority setting at its July 1996 meeting.</p>
<b>

<p>What Your Program Should Do.</b> 

<ol>
  <li><b>Review Current Priorities and Adopt Changes as Appropriate.</b> After considering the
    LSC suggested priorities, you should review your program&#146;s current priorities to
    ensure that they are specific and are framed to include all of the cases and matters to
    which the Board wants the program to devote its time and resources. The Board should
    revise the program&#146;s priorities if they are not written so that they cover all the
    program&#146;s legal work. We do not contemplate programs undertaking a new legal needs
    assessment assuming that current priorities were adopted in accordance with 45 CFR Part
    1620.<br>
  </li>
  <b>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p></b>To avoid any question regarding whether your program is engaged in activities which
  are not approved within the program's priorities we recommend that you draw your
  priorities specifically to cover both cases and matters as defined by the timekeeping
  regulation. A case is a distinct legal problem or set of closely related problems and the
  legal work performed by the attorneys and paralegals to resolve those problems. Cases
  include litigation, hearings, negotiations, advice, brief services and assistance with
  individual PAI cases. Matters are actions which contribute to the overall delivery of
  program services that do not involve direct legal advice or representation. Matters
  include community education, pro se clinics, training, CLE, preparing informational
  materials, and PAI recruitment.<a href="#sup2"><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup></a></p>
  <p>Please note as well that a priority category of &quot;other&quot; or
  &quot;miscellaneous&quot; is not sufficiently specific under 504(a)(9), unless it is
  further defined. It would be permissible to define a category of cases which may be
  accepted, even though not specifically set forth in the priorities if, for example, they
  involve threats to the health and safety of the applicant.</p>
  <b><p>Advice, brief service and referral. </b>You should review your intake system in
  light of the new requirements on priorities. A high percentage of the cases closed by
  recipients involve the provision of counsel and advice, brief service or referral
  assistance. Moreover, we realize that with the Corporation's encouragement, many
  recipients are increasingly employing centralized telephone intake and delivery systems to
  provide these services in a more efficient and effective manner. Often the issues
  addressed in those calls may not fall under cases listed as priorities for full
  representation. You may, however, give advice on cases or matters that are not specified
  as substantive case types so long as the priorities are framed to cover such advice. To
  accomplish this, you may enumerate advice and referral as a priority. However, brief
  service such as negotiation or the production of a letter to a third party should be in a
  substantive priority area.<a href="#sup3"><sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="2">
  <li><b>Develop a Policy and Procedure for Emergencies. </b>If your current priorities do not
    already do so, your Board needs to define what constitutes emergency situations and
    establish a procedure for acceptance of emergency cases or matters. Emergencies may be
    defined to include a variety of circumstances: 1) the need for immediate legal action to
    protect the client's rights; 2) a significant threat to the health and safety of the
    applicant for which no other legal help is available; and 3) issues that arise because of
    new and unforeseen circumstances, such as natural disasters, changes in the law affecting
    large numbers of clients and other emerging legal issues not anticipated when priorities
    were set. You should consider the severity of the consequences to the individual and
    family, the likelihood of success, the availability of other resources, and the overall
    expenditure of time and resources by the staff. <a href="#sup4"><sup><strong>(4)</strong></sup></a><p>The
    procedure should address who will determine that a particular case constitutes an
    emergency situation and how and when the request and approval are recorded.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Develop and have Staff Sign the Required Written Agreements. </b>You need to develop
    a written agreement, which each case handler must sign, affirming that only priority and
    emergency cases and matters will be undertaken. Staff not directly engaged in cases or
    matters are not required to sign the agreement. Intake and referral staff do not need to
    sign the agreement unless they give advice or brief service. PAI coordinators and training
    coordinators who engage in &quot;matters&quot; should sign the agreement. A staff member
    analyzing the facts presented on intake and referring the case will have to sign the
    agreement.<p>The agreement should specify that the case handler understands the
    priorities, the definition of an emergency situation, the procedure to follow with regard
    to emergencies, and that the case handler will not undertake non-priority cases or
    matters. The signed agreements should be kept in a separate file. A sample agreement is
    attached to this letter.</p>
    </font></li>
  <font SIZE="3">
  <li><b>Develop a System for Reporting to Your Board and to LSC. </b>You should develop a
    system to report to your Board and to LSC on cases and matters undertaken which are
    outside specific priorities. Under the appropriations act, all cases or matters that are
    undertaken by case handlers that are outside of priorities, including emergencies, must be
    reported to your Board on a quarterly basis and to LSC annually. You should develop a
    reporting form which gives the number of cases or matters undertaken that were not in
    accordance with the priorities, including emergencies, the types of cases or matters, the<br>
    reason they were undertaken, and other information your Board deems appropriate. You will
    need to report to your Board for the third quarter of 1996. The Corporation will provide a
    form for the annual report. It will be due by January 15, 1997.<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <u><b></li>
</ol>

<p>TIMING</p>
</b></u>

<p>Recipients should revise priorities as necessary within thirty (30) days from the date
that the Legal Services Corporation Board of Directors adopts an interim revised
regulation (July 20). The Staff Agreement should be developed and signed by that time as
well.</p>

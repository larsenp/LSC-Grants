<p><font color="#008000"><b>Scrolling Forms:</b></font> Because these forms are larger
than a single screen will contain, each form has a scroll bar along the right-hand margin
of the screen to enable you to see the rest of the form. Clicking on the scroll bar will
enable you to scroll down through a form. You may also use the Page-Down and Down-Arrow
keys to scroll down through a form. Similarly, you may use the scroll bar or Page-Up and
Up-Arrow keys to scroll back up through any form. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Entering Data:</b></font> Each form has certain information
pre-filled, like your organization's name and LSC Applicant ID. Each form will contain
cells for entering information. To enter data, click on the cell in which you want and
type in the information. You can use the Tab key to move to the next cell in a form.
Pressing the Shift and Tab keys simultaneously will enable you to move to the previous
cell. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Numeric Data:</b></font> Some forms require entry of numeric
information. These forms will not work properly with non-numeric data such as commas or
spaces. <b><i>Please do not enter commas or periods in numeric data, or leave a cell blank
instead of entering zero.</i></b> Entering commas, periods or any non-numeric data will
cause an error message while saving. The system will not allow you to save such data. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Saving Data:</b></font> Each form has buttons at the bottom
for Saving and Exiting. Please be sure to press the SAVE button prior to exiting the form
on which you have been working. <b><i>The EXIT button does not save information which you
have entered.</i></b> You may press the SAVE button at any time to save information which
you have entered.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Exiting Forms:</b></font> After saving the information which
you have entered, you may click on the EXIT button to leave the form on which you have
been working. You may exit from and return to any form as many times as you wish, provided
that you have not clicked on the SUBMIT button. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Printing Forms: </b></font>You can use your browser to print
the form that you are working on. Click on the print icon at the top of the screen when
you are ready to print and click on OK to print. </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Submitting Forms:</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are certain
that a form on which you have been working is complete, you may submit it to LSC by
clicking on the SUBMIT button. <b><i>Please do not press the SUBMIT button unless you are
certain that you no longer wish to work on the form.</i></b> After you have submitted a
form to LSC, you will be unable to access it without calling LSC to ask that we un-submit
the form. </p>

</strong></font></pre>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to remind you of the
criteria established in 45 C.F.R Part 1628.4, for approving
waivers of excess fund balances. Under this part of the
regulation, LSC may approve waiver requests for excess fund
balances due to &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot; Section
1628.4(b)(5) describes &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; as
&quot;windfall receipts for which a recipient cannot reasonably
plan, such as proceeds from the sale of property, receipt of
direct payments to attorneys and collection of insurance
proceeds.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, the Corporation
provided advance guidance to programs that LSC would regard the
serious threat of a drastic reduction in funding for 1996 as
meeting the &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;standard. Such
a reduction would have a severe impact on recipients' ability to
deliver services to eligible clients and it was deemed prudent to
plan for it and retain funds in order to avoid or ameliorate a
drastic and abrupt reduction in service to clients. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning with December 31,
1997 fund balances, LSC will no longer consider the 1996 funding
cuts as an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot; justifying a
waiver. To obtain a waiver of the 1997 fund balances, recipients
must specify the extraordinary circumstances consistent with
those described in §1628.4(b)(5). To provide guidance, here are
some examples of circumstances that would justify a waiver:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>windfall receipts from attorney fee awards consistent
            with current restrictions; insurance proceeds; sale
            of property and from other funding sources, for which
            the program could not reasonably plan; </li>
        <li>savings from an unusually high incidence of staff
            attrition; </li>
        <li>carryover of funds designated for capital purchases
            for which LSC's prior approval was obtained; and </li>
        <li>direct payments to private attorneys participating in
            recipient's PAI program, consistent with the
            provisions of §1628.3(d). </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Examples of circumstances that would <strong>not</strong> justify
a waiver:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1) savings from a normal level of staff attrition; </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>2) windfall receipts for which the program could
        reasonably have planned; e.g., windfall receipts during
        the first quarter of the year; and </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>3) carelessness in budgeting or allocating resources. </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We intend, however, to continue
to use the &quot;advance guidance&quot; procedure for programs
that anticipate a fund balance in excess of 10% of support and
have a good reason for expending the excess funds in the next
fiscal year. To utilize this procedure, a program should write to
LSC as far in advance of its fiscal year end as possible,
describing the anticipated excess fund balance, the reasons why
it is expected, and why it would be more economical and effective
to expend this excess fund balance in the next fiscal year. For
example, a program may be planning a substantial purchase which
could be made more advantageously in the next fiscal year than in
the current fiscal year, or a program may have specific reasons
to expect a significant diminution of non-LSC funding in the next
fiscal year and may want to save its current surplus to even out
available resources. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we agree with the program
that it has justified the anticipated excess funds carryover, we
will respond with an advance guidance letter stating that the
program may plan for an excess fund balance up to a certain
dollar amount. The program must still submit the normal fund
balance waiver request after its audit has been completed. LSC
will consider the advance guidance in the approval process and
approve the waiver if the information submitted is consistent
with the information submitted in support of the advance guidance
request. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This memorandum also is to
remind Program Directors who intend to submit requests for
waivers of excess fund balances for the year ended December 31,
1997, to ensure that their requests are submitted within the
deadline established in §1628.4. Annual audits for the year
ended December 31, 1997, are due to be submitted to the Office of
the Inspector General by April 30, 1998; consequently, the
deadline for submission of fund balance waiver requests is May
31, 1998. LSC will waive the time requirement only under
extraordinary circumstances, such as, an extension was given to
the program for submission of the audit, or there was a change in
program directors around the time the audit was completed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any questions
concerning this memorandum, please telephone Jay Brown, Office of
Program Operations, at (202) 336-8828 at your earliest
convenience.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this Program Letter is to inform all grantees
that we will again be requiring them to conduct a Self-Inspection of a sample of
closed cases prior to submitting 2000 Case Service Reporting (&quot;CSR&quot;)
data to the Legal Services Corporation (&quot;LSC&quot;). The Self-Inspection
must be completed and the enclosed Certification and Summary Forms signed and
returned to LSC no later than March 1, 2001. </font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LSC is committed to providing the United States Congress and
the public with the most accurate information possible. Closed case statistics
are a major constituent of the data on program activities collected by LSC and a
critical measure of the impact of federal funding on the legal problems of
people living in poverty. Therefore, it is essential to assure the accuracy of
the 2000 CSR data. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
      
<font size="3" COLOR="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Self-Inspection will be very similar to the one
conducted last year. Indeed, we have made a conscious effort to minimize changes
so the process will be familiar and the procedures LSC programs used last year
can again be used this year with the least possible expenditure of time and
effort. We have eliminated Question 8, because in many instances it was
duplicative of Question 7 -- and when it was not, it did not indicate the
reporting of a case that should not have been reported. We have added a requirement that programs
report on their certification form the number of cases excluded from their CSR
submission based on review after the Self-Inspection process was completed. This
requirement was added because it allows LSC to make a more accurate report of
the total number of cases closed after adjustment for the error rate revealed by
the Self-Inspection process. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
      
<font size="3" COLOR="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have added one new report on the number of cases closed
with non-LSC funds not reported to LSC because they were <b>not</b> LSC-eligible
or LSC eligibility was not documented. Since the CSR reporting criteria include
all LSC-eligible cases, regardless of funding source, we need this information
to be able to estimate what proportion of the cases reported are financed by LSC
and by Non-LSC funds. We have made this Self-Inspection Unreported Non-LSC Cases
Form very simple and we allow submission of estimates where the data has not
been collected in a program’s Case Management System. </font></p>

<font size="3" COLOR="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards for accurate reporting of CSR data are contained in
the 1999 CSR Handbook (as revised April 28, 2000 by Program Letter 2000-3 and
with corrections issued June 15, 2000). Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 5.2 of the
Handbook contain specific guidance on single recording of cases, timely closing
of cases, and documenting client eligibility. Section&nbsp;VI of the Handbook
contains guidance on the reporting of different levels of case services, and
Section VII contains guidance on the reporting of referrals. </font></p>

<font size="3" COLOR="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the Self-Inspection process is to give
programs a means to verify, by reviewing a sample of cases, that their 2000 CSR
data meets LSC standards for accuracy. The enclosed Case Review Form contains a
list of questions which identify key requirements that need to be met in order
to report a case to LSC. If the answers to the questions in the Case Review Form
are generally &quot;Yes&quot;, then the sampled cases generally meet the
requirements for reporting cases to LSC, and no further inquiry is necessary,
unless program staff have reason to believe that the sample selected was not
representative of the total number of cases to be reported to LSC or, for other
reasons, problems outside the sample would affect the accuracy of the 2000 CSR
data. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
      
<font size="3" COLOR="#000080" face="Times New Roman">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are &quot;No&quot; answers to applicable questions
in 10 percent or more of the cases sampled in the Self-Inspection process, then
the sample of cases tends to indicate that there are overall problems which may
affect the accuracy of the 2000 CSR data. In the event that the Self-Inspection
process does reveal such problems, then consultation with LSC is appropriate to
determine whether to initiate corrective action to find and correct problems in
cases not included in the Self-Inspection sample. <b><i>Under no circumstances
should action be taken to correct problems in sampled cases without action to
correct similar problems in cases not included in the sample. If such
corrections are made in the sample without correcting all similar cases, such
action would make the sample unrepresentative of the larger set of cases,
thereby defeating the purpose of the sample and making the Self-Inspection
results suspect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reach a level of absolute confidence that every 2000
closed case is accurately reported to LSC, program staff would need to review
each individual case. For most programs, such a review would be impractical.
Therefore, the Self-Inspection process relies on the selection of a sample of
cases from which programs can draw some inferences about the overall number of
cases reported to LSC. In order for the inferences to be reliable, however, the
sample must be reasonably representative of the total number of cases reported
to LSC. If the sample is not representative, its unrepresentative character
would undermine the integrity of the Self-Inspection results. </font>

The enclosed Sample Selection Procedure details a process for
selecting a sample of cases for review. The Procedure requires programs
reporting over 1,000 total closed cases to select a sample of approximately 150
closed cases. Programs reporting fewer than 1,000 total closed cases will need
to select a sample of 75 closed cases. Each grantee should document the steps
taken in the Selection Procedure, and should clearly indicate any departures
from the Selection Procedure. To consult with an LSC staff member about the
sampling procedure, please contact Bert Thomas at (202) 336-8938, e-mail </font><a HREF="mailto:thomasb@lsc.gov">thomasb@lsc.gov</a><font COLOR="#000080">. </font></font></p>

means of detecting such cases. In the interest of achieving accurate reporting
of 2000 closed cases, further effort to correct problems might also be
justified, provided doing so would not have a disproportionate impact on client
services. While the decision to undertake corrective action rests with the
program, LSC strongly encourages consultation before initiation of any
corrective action. To consult with LSC as to whether corrective action is
advisable or for other Self-Inspection questions (except sampling or case

during, or after the Self-Inspection either to remedy problems found or not to
report some cases at all. It also includes a report on the number of cases
excluded (removed) from the CSR report submitted to LSC as a result of
corrective action taken <b>after</b> the Self-Inspection. The purpose of

the Summary Form should accurately reflect the numbers of sampled cases for
which exceptions were noted (by &quot;No&quot; answers) in the completion of the
Case Review Forms for cases sampled. The collection of this information will
enable LSC and program staff to identify those areas where LSC reporting

corrective action is undertaken, it must apply to all affected cases, not just
to cases in the Self-Inspection sample. Programs undertaking corrective action

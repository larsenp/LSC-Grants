SERVICES CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 1999 FUNDING</strong></font><br>

<align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>AND NEW SERVICE AREAS
FOR YEAR 2000</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legal Services Corporation
(LSC) today announced its intent to award grants for 1999 and the
reconfiguration of selected service areas for year 2000 funding. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service areas in thirteen
states are eligible for three-year grants. Three-year grants will
be awarded for most service areas in New Mexico and
Massachusetts. Two-year grants will be awarded for most service
areas in six states: Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, North
Carolina, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. One-year grants will be
awarded to most service areas in Ohio, Indiana, Arizona, and
Nebraska. In California, service areas will receive grants for
all three periods. Variations in grant terms will be made to
further encourage programs in these states to continue developing
methods to enhance effective statewide services for clients.
Finally, all service areas eligible for one- or two-year renewals
will be funded for their full term. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, and again in 1998, the
Corporation required all legal services programs to begin or
continue planning processes to develop more effective statewide
legal services systems. A required element of the planning
process is an examination of the number of LSC programs in a
particular state to determine the most effective configuration
for delivering legal services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation also announced
today that beginning in the year 2000, several service areas will
be redefined and consolidated. Areas in Nebraska, parts of
Arizona, and the Bay Area of California will be affected by these
changes. The three service areas in Nebraska will be combined
into one statewide service area for competition in the year 2000.
In Arizona, two service areas around Tucson will be merged into
one, and four Native American service areas will be consolidated.
In the Bay Area of California, the Corporation will compete one
service area for the year 2000 instead of the six current service
areas. Based on an extensive review of available information from
the state planning process, the Corporation believes these new
service areas represent a more effective structure for delivering
services to low-income persons in these communities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For FY 1999, the Congress
appropriated $300 million for LSC, a $17 million increase over
last year&#146;s budget. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Legal Services
Corporation is a private, non-profit corporation created by
Congress in 1974 to ensure access to justice for all Americans.</i></p>

            <br wp="br2">

            <br>

          <li>The numbers of people providing input, and the categories they represent, e.g., current
            clients, client eligible persons, program staff, governing body members, the private bar,
            judges, community groups, and public agencies, assure input from a broad and reasonably
            representative sample of those knowledgeable of client needs. <br wp="br1">
            <br wp="br2">
          </li>

            sense) of the service area client eligible population. Note that there may be fewer formal

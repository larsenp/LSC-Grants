<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part I of this memorandum
describes the prior approval process. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part II of this memorandum
describes information to include in a request for prior approval.
This memorandum supersedes the January 12, 1995, LSC memorandum
on the same subject. </p>

<p><strong>PART- I. The Prior Approval Process</strong> </p>

<p><u>The Timing of Prior Approval</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approval to purchase
non-expendable property, real property, and leases of equipment,
furniture, or other non-expendable property; pursuant to 45
C.F.R.§ 1630.5(b), should be obtained before signing a contract
to purchase or lease equipment or purchase and improve real
property. For pre-award costs and costs incurred after the
cessation of funding, programs should seek approval prior to
incurring the costs. <strong>After-the-fact approval does not
satisfy the prior approval requirement of 45 C.F.R.§ 1630.5(b). </strong></p>

<p><u>Determination by OPO to Approve</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasonableness is the standard
which guides the decision of OPO whether to approve an
expenditure of LSC funds. OPO adheres to the definition of
reasonable cost which appears at 45 C.F.R. § 1630.3(b). OPO will
approve an expenditure as being reasonable when an approval
request demonstrates that: 1) the expenditure is of a type and
amount generally recognized as ordinary and necessary to the
operation of a legal services program or the performance of the
grant or contract; 2) the program requesting approval has
followed generally accepted sound business practices, arms-length
bargaining, Federal and State laws and regulations; and the terms
and conditions of the grant or contract; 3) the program acted
prudently under the circumstances; and 4) the program did not
significantly deviate from its established practices which may
unjustifiably increase the grant or contract costs. </p>

<p><u>The Effect of Approval</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless otherwise provided in a
letter granting prior approval pursuant to 45 C.F.R. §
1630.5(c), the approval by OPO of an expenditure is effective for
one year from the date of the letter approval. Prior approval is
LSC's acknowledgment that an expenditure is reasonable and
necessary according to 45 C.F.R. § 1630.3(b). Programs are
responsible for ensuring that their accounting for expenditures
meets the requirements of 45 C.F.R. § 1630.3(a). All
expenditures of LSC funds must meet the nine criteria of that
section. </p>

<p><strong>PART - II. Information to Include in a Request for
Approval</strong> </p>

<p><u>Leases and Purchases of Personal Property</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to 45 C.F.R. §
1630.5(b), programs planning to expend LSC funds to lease or
purchase personal property valued over $10,000 must obtain LSC's
prior approval. Programs seeking prior approval of a lease or
purchase of personal property should submit to OPO, three written
bids (except when bids are not obtained for the reasons explained
in (3)), and a letter or memorandum containing: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) <u>Statement of Need</u>. The statement should explain
    how the purchase will further the delivery of legal services
    to eligible clients; </p>
    <p>2) <u>Description of the Property to be Leased or
    Purchased</u>. The description should identify each component
    of the lease or purchase by manufacture and model; the
    quantity to be leased or purchased; the total dollar amount
    of the lease or purchase; and the identity of the vendor or
    vendors of the product; and </p>
    <p>3) <u>Description of the Vendor Selection Process</u>. The
    description should explain the reason for selecting the
    vendor or vendors, including the identities of vendors who
    submitted bids; the amounts of the bids; and the
    manufacturer, model, and quantity of the products which the
    bidders offered. In the absence of bids, the description
    should explain why obtaining bids was not practical. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Purchases of Real Property</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to 45 C.F.R. §|
1630.5(b)(3) and (4), programs planning to expend LSC funds to
purchase real property or make capital expenditures exceeding
$10,000 to improve real property must obtain LSC's prior
approval. Leases of real property do not require LSC's approval.
Programs seeking prior approval of a purchase of real property
should submit to OPO a letter or memorandum containing: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) <u>Statement of Need</u>. The statement should explain
    how the purchase will further the delivery of legal services
    to eligible clients. Specifically, the statement should
    discuss: </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a) the location of the property in terms of
        accessibility to program clients; </p>
        <p>b) trends in funding and program staffing levels in
        relation to space needs; and </p>
        <p>c) whether the property will replace or be in addition
        to existing program offices.</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2) <u>Cost Analysis</u>. The analysis should compare the
    estimated annual costs of the planned purchase over the life
    of the financing of the purchase with the estimated annual
    costs of renting or purchasing other, similar property over
    the same time period. The comparison should include estimates
    of the costs of maintenance, utilities, and taxes. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3) <u>Current Independent Appraisal</u>. The appraisal
    should be of a type sufficient to secure a mortgage.</p>
    <p>4) <u>Documentation of Board Approval</u>. The
    documentation can be a copy of a board resolution or board
    minutes demonstrating approval of the purchase. </p>
    <p>5) <u>Statement of Handicapped Accessibility</u>. This
    statement is necessary to meet the requirement of 45 C.F.R.
    § 1624.5(c) that program offices be accessible to
    handicapped persons. </p>
    <p>6) <u>Explanation of the Financing of the Purchase</u>.
    The explanation should describe the estimated total cost of
    the purchase; the terms of a mortgage or other debt obtained
    to finance the purchase; including the amount of monthly
    mortgage payment and the source of funds to be used to pay
    the monthly mortgage; the source and amount of funds to be
    applied to a down payment; and the source and estimated
    amounts of funds to cover moving, renovations, and closing
    costs.</p>
    <p>7) <u>Copy of a Purchase Agreement or Contract</u>. This
    document should include a description of the property and the
    terms of the purchase. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reversionary Interest
Agreement. At the time of approval, the Corporation and the
recipient purchasing real property will enter into a reversionary
interest agreement approved by the LSC Office of General Counsel.
The existence of an executed Reversionary Interest Agreement will
be a condition for the Corporation's approval of the purchase.</p>

<p><u>Capital Expenditures to Improve Real Property </u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programs seeking approval of
capital expenditure over $10,000 to improve real property should
submit to OPO a letter or memorandum containing:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) <u>Statement of Need</u>. The statement should explain
    how the expenditure will further the delivery of legal
    services to clients. Specifically, the statement should
    discuss: </p>
    <p>A statement of need with the improvement(s), including the
    nature of the work to be done, the name of the contractor
    performing the work, and the total expected cost of the
    improvements; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2) <u>A Description of the Contractor Selection Process</u>.
    A description of the process to select the contractor
    including the names of the contractors submitting quotations,
    the amounts of the quotations, and a brief explanation of the
    way the contractor who will perform the work was selected. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Costs Incurred After the Cessation of Funding</u> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programs seeking approval of
costs to be incurred after cessation of funding must, prior to
incurring the cost, submit to OPO a request for approval
demonstrating that the costs are related to closure of the LSC
funded activities, such as: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) Costs associated with the closing or transfer of
    clients' cases; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2) Rental costs under unexpired leases;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3) Settlement expenses including: closeout audit,
    accounting, legal, clerical and indirect costs related to
    salaries and wages, or other similar expenditures. In
    addition, the request should set forth a statement of:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a) non-LSC funds available to the program; and</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>b) whether the program will continue to operate as a
        legal entity, and other facts deemed appropriate to
        support the request. </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approval of the costs to be
incurred after the cessation of funding will not be provided
unless the program has submitted to LSC the following
information: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) the amount of LSC fund balance at the time of cessation
    of funding; </p>
    <p>2) a statement indicating the reason or reasons for the
    existence of the fund balance; </p>
    <p>3) the program's plan for the disposition of the fund
    balance, including a description of the types of cases or
    matters on which the program will expend the fund balance;</p>
    <p>4) a certification that the LSC fund balance will be
    expended in accordance with the LSC Act, regulations, and the
    current appropriations act governing LSC funds; and </p>
    <p>5) an accounting for all property which was purchased in
    whole or in part with LSC funds and which has a current book
    or market value exceeding $1,000. The property accounting
    should include: a) a brief description of the property item;
    b) the date of acquisition of the property item; c) the total
    amount of funds expended to acquire the property; d) the
    amount of LSC funds expended to acquire the property; e) the
    current book or estimated market value of the property; and
    f) if the property is to be retained, a certification that
    the program shall use the property in connection with the
    delivery of legal assistance to low-income persons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programs which have used LSC
funds to acquire real property, should submit an accounting of
the real property upon cessation of funding which includes the
following information: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) the address and a brief description of the property and
    the date it was acquired; </p>
    <p>2) the total amount of funds expended to acquire or
    improve the property, including principal and interest
    payments, and payment for capitol improvements; </p>
    <p>3) the current assessed and estimated market values of the
    property;</p>
    <p>4) the amount of outstanding debt on the property; </p>
    <p>5) a statement indicating the program's plan for disposing

    <p>6) copies of any agreements or contracts governing
    disposition of the property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition the program should submit verification of
prepayment of a final audit. </p>

<p><u>Pre-award Costs </u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-award costs are those
incurred prior to the effective date of the award directly
pursuant to the negotiation and in anticipation of the award
where such costs are necessary to comply with the proposed
delivery schedule. Programs which expect to incur pre-award costs
must seek LSC approval of those costs prior to incurring them.
LSC will grant approval of those costs provided that they meet
the requirements of 45 C.F.R. Part 1630 and provided that the
program has received a grant award letter from LSC confirming
that an award of LSC funds is imminent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programs seeking approval of
pre-award costs should submit to OPO a letter or memorandum
containing: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) <u>Statement of Need</u>. The statement should explain
    how the expenditure is necessary to its performance of the
    grant and reasonable in light of the circumstances; and </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2) <u>Budget for the Expenditure</u>. </p>

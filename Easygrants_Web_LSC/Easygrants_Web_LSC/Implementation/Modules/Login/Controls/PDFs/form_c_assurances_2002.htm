    grant does not constitute a termination or suspension under LSC regulations. During the
    term of the grant, authority for LSC to disburse some of the funds
    under the grant award may be rescinded by Congress, or sequestered, thereby reducing the
    actual amount of funds disbursed under the grant. Further, additional restrictions may be
    imposed on the use of funds as a result of such appropriation, authorization legislation,
    or other law. In subsequent years, the amount of and conditions upon funding may be
    changed to conform to Congressional appropriation levels and legislated restrictions. Such
    changes and reductions, however implemented by the LSC, shall not
    constitute a termination or suspension.<!--mstheme--></font></td>

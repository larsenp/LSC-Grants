<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Program Letter is to
provide guidance regarding submission of 1999 subgrant agreements
for LSC approval.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Announcement of 1999 LSC grant
awards is not expected until the first week of December 1998;
however, the 45 C.F.R. Part 1627 grant approval process allows 45
days for LSC review of proposed subgrant agreements. Thus,
recipients that contemplate entering into a subgrant which has a
January 1, 1999 commencement date, should submit their subgrant
approval requests without awaiting outcome of the grant approval
process in order to avoid disruption and allow time for
compliance with the prior approval procedures of 45 C.F.R. Part
1627. <a href="#sup1"><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup></a> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the 45 C.F.R Part
1627 time line, subgrants with a January 1, 1999 commencement
date should usually be submitted to LSC for approval by November
14, 1998. However, due to the time line of the competitive
process, LSC will consider any subgrant received by December 1,
1998 to be submitted timely for January 1, 1999 approval.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until further notice, LSC will
continue the current procedures for requesting approval for
subgrant agreements for 1999 and will use the same Subgrant
Agreement Form used in 1998. Also included in this package are a
1999 Budget Form and a Subrecipient Profile Form, which must
accompany each request for approval of a subgrant agreement. To
obtain approval, recipients should submit two fully executed
copies of the agreement. In addition, recipients should ensure
that an audit for the 1998 subgrant, has been submitted to the
Office of the Inspector General in accordance with the terms of
the 1998 subgrant agreement. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate and expedite the
review of your request for approval of 1999 subgrants , you are
encouraged to use the Subgrant Agreement Form enclosed. If you do
not use the Subgrant Agreement Form, your proposed agreement
should, at a minimum, include the substance of the provisions in
that form and must include the Budget Form and Subrecipient
Profile Form, if it is to be approved.</p>

<p><b>PAI Subgrants </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to 45 C.F.R Part
1627, subgrants are also affected by 45 C.F.R. Part 1610. This is
the regulation designed to implement statutory restrictions on
the use of non-LSC funds by LSC recipients. Section 1610.7(c) is
particularly relevant, which provides :</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For a transfer of LSC
funds to bar associations, <i>pro bono</i> programs, private
attorneys or law firms, or other entities for the sole purpose of
funding private attorney involvement (PAI) activities pursuant to
45 C.F.R. Part 1614, the prohibitions or requirements of this
part shall apply only to the funds transferred.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please contact Jay Brown,
Program Analyst, at (202) 336-8828, if you have any questions
concerning this memorandum. </p>

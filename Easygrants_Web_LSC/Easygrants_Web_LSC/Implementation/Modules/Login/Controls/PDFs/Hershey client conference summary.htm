<p><font color="#800000"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For
three days in April, 2001, LSC brought together 51 representatives of the legal
services community—program staff at all levels, client board members and
representatives of community organizations, and other stakeholders, including
state IOLTA Directors, a judge, and a private attorney who chairs a state
planning committee, as well as 25 guests, representing national organizations,
and LSC staff—to discuss a broad range of issues relating to the broad theme
of “creating client centered communities of justice.” All of the
participants have been involved in one way or another in client-centered
activities in their home states and all made a commitment to follow up with
client centered initiatives at home when they returned from the conference. LSC
selected the participants from among the applicants with an effort to reflect a
broad range of diversity—by program role, race, gender, and type of
experience.<o:p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">LSC
identified the objectives of the conference as:<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">To
    converse openly and frankly with each other about the challenges of
    functioning as a “client centered” legal services system.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">To
    consider the challenges and opportunities that arise in building and
    maintaining client centered legal services given the many changes that
    affect legal services programs and their clients in the 21<sup>st</sup>
    century.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">To
    improve our understanding of how legal services programs can respond more
    directly to clients’ needs.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">To
    identify ways in which clients and client groups can work in partnership
    with programs.<o:p>
    &nbsp;</font>
    </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">The
conference was truly designed to be a “conversation.” No effort was made to
achieve consensus or to reach conclusions or decisions. Rather, the goal was for
participants to share their thoughts and ideas and listen to one another. The
LSC design team—Ernestine Watlington, Edna Fairbanks-Williams, Randi Youells,
Michael Genz, Robert Gross, Reginald Haley, and Regina Derzon—and Facilitator
John Tull created a structure designed to promote informal, open-ended
discussion. Before the conference, as a stimulus to discussion, participants
were provided with a group of papers addressing a variety of different issues
from a range of different perspectives. At the conference, the authors of some
of the papers, along with a few other participants, made brief presentations
about particular client-centered initiatives they are involved in. Some
discussion took place in plenary sessions, but much of the conference was
devoted to discussion in small groups. There were four randomly-chosen small
groups, each led by a team consisting of one client representative and one staff
person (program or national). Small groups discussion in the first two days of
the conference focused on changes affecting client communities; models for
client centered legal services; and technology-based delivery of services. The
key points of these discussions were noted on flip charts, but no final report
was made back to the plenary session. On Saturday, the final day of the
conference,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>each participant was
asked to respond in writing to three questions:<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">What
    are the three most valuable insights you have gotten from the previous two
    days work?<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">What
    do these insights suggest regarding possible changes in your program and in
    your state?<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">Are
    there roles for LSC and other national organizations in supporting
    appropriate changes?<o:p>
    &nbsp;</font>
    </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">These
questions served as the basis for the last small group discussions, which were
reported back to the plenary group as part of the final conversation of the
conference. <o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">Participants
were enthusiastic about the value and quality of the discussion and urged that
it be continued in other contexts. In the final session, facilitator John Tull
summarized the main themes that had emerged during the conference as:<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">The
richness of what is going on at the program and state level.</font></span></b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">
Participants heard about a number of exciting initiatives that are very
different, but all client centered in their own ways. Those that generated the
most discussion were community economic development, holistic approaches to
delivering services, technology based delivery mechanisms, and involvement of
client councils in building leadership and capacity in low-income communities.
In John’s words, “We all felt that we learned a great deal we had not known
before. We are all taking away more than we brought.”<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">The
need for broader connections and new partnerships.</font></span></b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"> Participants spoke of
“getting out of the legal services box,” breaking down institutional
barriers, and finding new and different ways to engage with client communities
and other agencies and groups who work with them. <o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">The
importance of involving clients in the delivery of legal services and the need
for greater inclusiveness in client representation.</font></span></b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-family:
Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> Participants stressed
the importance of involving clients in legal services in meaningful ways at all
levels of the system. In light of the increasing diversity of country, it is
especially important that programs reach out to emerging communities.<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">The
need for capacity building at national, state and program levels.</font></span></b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
Institutional structures for including the client viewpoint need to be
strengthened at all levels. Providing training and capacity building within the
client community must be a key role of these structures.<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">The
need for continuing conversations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></span></b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Many
conference participants commented on the high quality of the discussion at the
conference and the fact that people were really listening attentively to one
another. Participants agreed about the need to build on and expand the
discussion at the conference, through newly created structures that will make it
possible to broaden the discussion to include others in the community.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>

the opening plenary session, Alan Houseman presented an overview of his
conference paper on the demographic and other changes affecting client
communities and the new legal issues that are emerging as a result. While
emphasizing the importance of looking beyond the census data, which
under-reports data about many issues affecting low-income people, participants
confirmed that these changes were having a major impact on their communities and
the communities they serve.<o:p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800000">In
small groups, participants were asked to discuss the following questions:
“What’s happening in your community (changes in who clients are, changes in
clients’ lives, emerging legal issues facing low-income people)? What should
legal services providers/state justice communities be doing in response?”<o:p>

There may not even be a client in the traditional sense at the beginning of the

needs and creates opportunities that clients will respond to. This requires a
whole new set of collaborations and listening skills. Examples include: setting
up a separate non-profit to create and manage Individual Development Accounts
for members of some 30 other non-profits serving the client community;
entrepreneurship classes and assistance with fundraising and micro lending for

services to individuals <u>and</u> impact work <u>and </u>community development.
Instead of being afraid of being overwhelmed, we should focus on locating the
resources to get it done. To do so requires us to join with others who are
working on poverty issues (the civil rights community, for example). She urged
legal services programs to play a visionary role, looking beyond program turf to
true client need, serving as catalyst for change for individuals and whole
communities. True client empowerment requires careful listening, asking “what
do you need,” and creating the circumstances where you can respond to those
needs by reaching out to other organizations and bringing them in to take action
collectively.<o:p>

Cohen, Executive Director of the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, California,
made a presentation about the program’s I-CAN! project, a system designed to
help clients to fill out judicial forms on their own. I-CAN! uses a
sophisticated, touch-screen computer with audio and visual components to provide
explanations and ask questions that the client answers to complete a particular
form. It then prints the form and instructs the client where and how to file it.
Users can respond to questions in a language other than English and have the
form printed out in English. I-CAN! “kiosks” are currently housed in two
locations: the Orange County Superior Courts Family Law Center and the offices
of Legal Aid Society. Bob emphasized that the service did not represent a
substitute for representation by an attorney, but rather provided support to
people who were currently going without any assistance at all. <o:p>

        <p align="center"><b>New Corporate Pro Bono Opportunity<br>
        For Legal Services Corporation Grantees<br>
        </p>
        </b>
        <p>As a Legal Services Corporation grantee, your program is invited to
        participate in CorporateProBono.Org, an exciting new venture designed to
        exponentially increase the amount of pro bono work performed by in-house
        counsel and to assist legal services and pro bono programs in
        publicizing and placing pro bono matters with in-house lawyers.</p>
        <p>CPBO, a joint initiative of the American Corporate Counsel
        Association (ACCA) and the Pro Bono Institute at Georgetown University
        Law Center (PBI), includes a web site launched in October, 2000 that
        will allow corporate counsel to search for volunteer opportunities and
        locate tools, information, and resources concerning pro bono
        participation that are targeted to their unique skills, needs, and
        practice setting Legal services and pro bono programs will also be able
        to access information on the special concerns and interests of corporate
        in-house lawyers.</p>
        <p>In addition, LSC-funded programs that provide quality control,
        training, and support to volunteers may become CPBO network partners.
        Network partners will have the capacity to quickly and easily post a
        program description as well as information about current pro bono
        matters that need volunteers. Pro bono projects can include one-on-one
        representation, clinics, counseling legal clients, transactional pro
        bono work, or other client services. Those LSC grantees that meet CPBO’s
        posting standards and become network partners will receive special
        access to the site which will enable them to edit, update, and add and
        subtract information and pro bono postings on their own with a minimum
        of time and effort. They will also receive regular reports from CPBO on
        how their postings are doing, as well as additional information on
        corporate pro bono trends. Many programs would welcome the opportunity
        to tap the volunteer resources of in-house legal departments, but lack
        the contacts or information needed to make that connection. CPBO is an
        electronic introduction service that permits legal services programs to
        &quot;market&quot; themselves to thousands of potential in-house
        volunteers in a matter of minutes (the ACCA web site, with which CPBO is
        being integrated, currently receives more than 2.5 million
        &quot;hits&quot; each month).</p>
        <p>To post a profile of your program and/or a description of current pro
        bono opportunities and projects, simply go to <a href="http://www.cpbo.org">www.cpbo.org</a>
        and complete the appropriate form. If you have any questions or comments
        about CPBO or the posting process, please contact us at <a href="mailto:cpbo@probonoinst.org">cpbo@probonoinst.org</a>.</p>
        <p>CPBO also welcomes submissions of substantive handbooks or manuals
        that you have developed on poverty law topics that, in your experience,
        have proven useful for volunteers. While the CPBO site is not designed
        to serve as a comprehensive source of information about poverty law and
        public interest practice, corporate counsel have requested that we place
        on the site some of the best examples of the types of training materials
        available from network partner programs. If your materials are included
        on the site, we will, of course, credit your program and encourage CPBO
        site visitors to learn more about you. We expect that, as in-house
        lawyers become more familiar with and engaged in pro bono practice, they
        will also use the web sites of network partner programs which will be
        publicized on and linked to the CPBO site. One of the most effective
        techniques to attract corporate volunteers to your site, however, is to
        use CPBO to provide an example of the quality and wealth of resources
        your program offers. If you wish to submit a manual, handbook or other
        substantive/training document for posting to the CPBO website, simply
        send your materials to the CPBO staff at the Pro Bono Institute via
        e-mail at <a href="mailto:cpbo@probonoinst.org">cpbo@probonoinst.org</a>
        or by mail to Pro Bono Institute at Georgetown University Law Center, 50
        F Street, NW, Suite 8300, Washington, DC 20001.</p>
        <p><b>Additional Information about CorporateProBono.Org</p>
        </b><i>
        <p>What is CorporateProBono.Org?</p>
        </i>
        <p>CorporateProBono.Org (CPBO) is an exciting new venture designed to
        exponentially increase the amount of pro bono work performed by in-house
        counsel. CPBO will enable pro bono, legal services, and public interest
        programs to more easily and efficiently place matters and recruit
        volunteers from corporate legal departments and will enable law firms to
        solicit corporate partners for their pro bono matters and projects.</p>
        <p>A joint initiative of the American Corporate Counsel Association (ACCA)
        and the Pro Bono Institute at Georgetown University Law Center (PBI),
        CPBO includes a web site, supported by knowledgeable staff, that will
        heighten the visibility and momentum of pro bono among corporate legal
        departments, develop, assemble, and publicize information geared to the
        unique needs of in-house counsel and workable models for legal
        department-supported pro bono efforts, and promote partnerships between
        legal departments and legal services providers or law firms with strong
        pro bono programs. Through the use of cutting-edge technology, CPBO
        enables legal services providers and others to quickly and easily post
        and update information about their programs and pro bono offerings and
        permits in-house lawyers to search for volunteer opportunities that are
        of interest to them.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Isn’t CPBO competing with local programs for scarce pro bono
        resources?</p>
        </i>
        <p>No. CPBO is not in the business of recruiting pro bono in-house
        attorneys. It is, rather, a facilitator, making it easier for corporate
        counsel who are considering pro bono work and legal services providers
        who wish to involve more in-house counsel to seek each other out by
        using the power of the Internet. To date, only a few legal services
        providers have successfully integrated in-house lawyers into their pro
        bono efforts. Pro bono participation rates among in-house lawyers are
        low. CPBO is an easily accessible introduction service. Once providers
        and in-house lawyers find each other, we anticipate that they will
        develop their own procedures and networks for pro bono referrals and
        other mutually supportive programs. CPBO is a tool that helps legal
        department lawyers and pro bono providers take that all-important first
        step.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Since my program will have to post information on the CPBO website,
        will it be worth the time and trouble?</p>
        </i>
        <p>Yes, yes, yes! First, we are using cutting-edge technology that will
        minimize the time and complexity of the posting process. Modeled after
        ACCA’s successful job posting service, posting information about your
        program and/or about specific pro bono opportunities will require only a
        few minutes of your time and no special technical expertise. Will it be
        worth it? The American Corporate Counsel Association (ACCA) is the
        leading association of in-house counsel, and ACCA’s website, which
        will be fully integrated with the CPBO site, currently receives more
        than 2.5 million &quot;hits&quot; each month. In light of ACCA’s
        leadership in CPBO, we anticipate that the site will attract a steady
        stream of potential corporate counsel volunteers that you can access.</p>
        <i>
        <p>What if my program does not have e-mail or a website?</p>
        </i>
        <p>It is not necessary to have a website to fully utilize CPBO and its
        resources. And, while we would strongly prefer to receive information
        and materials electronically, since the CPBO staff is quite small, we
        will have a limited capacity to accommodate programs that lack e-mail
        capacity by converting their submissions into electronic postings.</p>
        <i>
        <p>How can I be sure that only pro bono matters currently in need of pro
        bono counsel are posted on the site?</p>
        </i>
        <p>If your program is an LSC grantee, ABA Pro Bono Committee-affiliated
        pro bono program or NLADA member, and you meet the site posting criteria
        (i.e., you offer training, support, and other quality support and
        quality control mechanisms for your pro bono matters), you may become a
        CPBO Network Partner. Network Partner programs will not only be able to
        post information directly to the CPBO website; they will have the
        capacity to delete, update, supplement, or otherwise amend their
        posting. If your program initiates a new project that uses volunteers,
        you can advertise that new program to a wide range of potential pro bono
        attorneys in one simple step. In addition, Network Partner programs will
        receive periodic reports on usage of the CPBO website, so that you can
        see how many visitors have viewed your program’s postings and check
        out the most popular postings to learn more about what attracts the
        attention of in-house lawyers.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Will I have access to information about models for involving in-house
        lawyers in pro bono work?</p>
        </i>
        <p>Absolutely. One of the other benefits of the site for legal services
        providers is access to customized materials on issues specific to
        in-house pro bono. If a potential volunteer is concerned about
        malpractice and liability issues, you can provide her with a monograph
        on dealing with malpractice issues in the in-house context. If you are
        contacted by an attorney in a small legal department who is seeking your
        help in designing a pro bono program for that department, you will find
        examples of successful small legal department programs on the CPBO
        website.</p>
        <i>
        <p>What will all this cost?</p>
        </i>
        <p>The CPBO website is absolutely free for legal services providers. As
        a Network Partner, you will have access to all elements of this
        content-rich site.</p>
        <i>
        <p>The CPBO site will contain some substantive materials on poverty law
        and public interest practice. Isn’t that unnecessarily duplicative of
        information and materials already available on other websites?</p>
        </i>
        <p>CPBO is not designed to be a major source of substantive materials
        and manuals on poverty law and public interest practice. However, our
        discussions with in-house counsel have convinced us that it is important
        to have a sampling of manuals and training materials available on the
        site, so that potential volunteers can see for themselves that the
        support they need to do pro bono work effectively will be available to
        them if they volunteer. We will, of course, identify the sources of
        materials and provide links to sites that maintain extensive
        compilations of substantive materials as well. Placing a few examples of
        what is available on the CPBO site will encourage lawyers to travel to
        these other sites, and, hopefully, to become frequent visitors.</p>
        <i>
        <p>In soliciting corporate in-house lawyers as volunteers, don’t we
        create conflict of interest problems?</p>
        </i>
        <p>As with any pro bono program, there is always the potential for
        conflict of interest - i.e., a situation in which the lawyer, law firm,
        or legal department represents the opposing party or is advocating a
        contrary legal position on behalf of a client. However, for the most
        part there should be fewer conflicts in the corporate legal department
        situation, since in-house lawyers represent only one client - the
        corporation - in their day-to-day practice. Certainly, some times of
        matters - such as consumer or finance issues - may not be appropriate
        for certain types of corporate legal departments, such as banks. In
        general, however, many of the pro bono matters providers seek to place -
        family law cases, landlord/tenant, public benefits, education,
        transactional matters - will pose no conflicts problems.</p>
        <i>
        <p>Are there other uses that the CPBO website can serve?</p>
        </i>
        <p>CPBO will make it easier for legal services providers to contact
        corporate counsel on a wide range of issues. For example, if a program
        wants to advertise its pro bono training events and open them to
        corporate counsel, it can use the website to get the word out. If
        programs are seeking access to donated computers or other equipment,
        they can advertise their needs on the CPBO website. If a group of legal
        services providers has just launched a new statewide fundraising
        initiative, information about that initiative can be publicized on the
        website’s &quot;newsworthy&quot; section. If a national support center
        has developed a new manual that it wants to advertise for sale, the CPBO
        web site can promote the manual. Although the primary target audience
        for the CPBO website is in-house counsel, it is our goal to use that
        site in every way possible to benefit legal services and pro bono
        providers and their clients.</p>

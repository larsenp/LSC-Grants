Advice and Referral System.</b></p>
</font>

<p>After considering comments received from the field to these draft characteristics,
LSC&#146;s Office of Program Performance plans to publish the characteristics in a Program
Letter and use them as the best practice standard when evaluating programs&#146; intake
systems.</p>

<p>In arriving at the <b>Draft Characteristics</b>, LSC staff reviewed many documents
describing standards for intake systems including the ABA <b>Draft Standards For The
Operation of A Telephone Hotline Providing Legal Advice and Information</b> and the AARP <b>Legal
Hotline Best Practice Tips Guide </b>published in July 2000. We also solicited input from
a number of leaders in the arena of intake systems. These Draft Characteristics were also
presented during a workshoip on &quot;Best Practices&quot; at the March ABA/NLADA Equal
Justice Conference.</p>

<p>The Legal Services Corporation has vocally advocated the use of Telephone Intake Advice
and Referral Systems for many years. In 1996 LSC and the Legal Counsel for the Elderly
sponsored a Conference on Centralized Telephone Intake and Delivery. The Office of the
Inspector General that year published <i>Increasing Legal Services Delivery Capacity
through Information Technology</i>. In March 1997 LSC published <i>Basic Elements of
Effective Centralized Telephone Intake and Delivery Systems</i> in which LSC advocated the
use of a centralized telephone intake system. In September of 1997 <i>Uses of Technology
in Centralized Telephone Intake And Delivery Systems </i>was published and in March 1998
LSC published <i>Intake Systems Report Innovative Uses of Centralized Telephone Intake and
Delivery in Five Programs</i>.</p>

<p>LSC now wants to obtain as many opinions as possible from all interested parties before
proceeding to the next step in publishing the <b>Characteristics</b> in a Program Letter
later this year. The <b>Characteristics</b> will then be included in the LSC Evaluation
Guidelines and used as part of the competitive bidding evaluation process.</p>

<p>We request that you send your comments to John C. Eidleman, Program Counsel, at <a
HREF="mailto:eidlemaj@lsc.gov">eidlemaj@lsc.gov</a> by June 7, 2001. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Introduction to the Characteristics</b> </p>
</font>

<p>These characteristics apply to telephone advice and referral intake systems. LSC
recognizes that telephone advice and referral intake systems are not the only way that
clients access services. Indeed, a telephone advice and referral intake system may not be
the best way for certain segments of the client population to access services. However,
LSC does recognize that a telephone advice and intake system is the most effective and
efficient method of providing services to the vast majority of legal service
programs&#146; clients.</p>

<p>These Characteristics are intended to be progressive, forward looking and aspirational.
At the same time, we intend them to be realistic and achievable. LSC knows that some
recipients can only seek to reach these Characteristics in the future. The development of
a superb intake system can be expensive. Strategic planning is necessary in developing an
intake system to ensure that the system has adequate resources to do its job well. At the
same time, the intake system should not be a drain of essential resources from other
critical parts of the delivery system, including extended services.</p>

<p>These Characteristics apply to both free-standing and extended service programs.<sup>1</sup>
LSC does not have a preference between these two types of intake systems and believes that
both serve an important and needed role in serving clients. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Draft Characteristics of an Intake Advice and Referral System </p>

<p>(a) Client Access </p>

<p>Applicants should have prompt access to a person who can initiate the intake process in
a courteous and professional manner </p>
</b>

<p>The intake interview is primarily done by telephone.</p>

<p>Exceptions are made for the convenience of clients including those without a telephone
or unable to communicate by telephone.</p>

<p>Offices, outreach sites or other arrangements are available for applicants who need
in-person interviews.</p>

<p>There is a policy to deal with call volume that provides access within a reasonable
period of time after the initial contact. One example is an Automatic Call Distribution
phone system that places applicants in a queue for no more than twenty minutes. </p>

<p>When placed on hold, the applicant is told of the estimated waiting time or given the
option to call back. </p>

<p>Applicants can speak with a legal worker at the time of initial contact in most cases.</p>

<p>Intake systems that are designed to avoid callbacks are favored. Callbacks are used
infrequently. Circumstances include when none of the staff is available, the applicant has
been given the option to receive a callback rather than wait in the queue or the call is
received outside of the regular hours of operation of the intake system.<i> </i>When
callbacks are use they should designate a time when the call will be made<i>.</i> If a
callback occurs, it generally<i> </i>occurs within 24 hours of the call.</p>

<p>LSC encourages intake systems that have evening or Saturday hours to help applicants
who cannot access the system during normal office hours.</p>

<p>When the intake system is accessed outside of business hours, a recorded message
informs the applicant of the hours of operation. </p>

<p>Calls are local or toll-free. Documents can be faxed to the intake worker without cost
to the applicant. Arrangements are made, by the program, with social service and other
agencies for applicants to use the agencies&#146; fax capabilities at no charge to send
documents to the program.</p>

<p>There are regular hours of operation, publicized and known in the client community.</p>

<p>Applicants are clearly informed of the scope of service that will be available from the
intake system. If it provides only advice, brief service and referral the applicant must
be clear as to the limitations.</p>

<p>There are specific, written protocols for emergencies and walk-ins.</p>

<p>There are specific, written protocols describing the operation of the intake system
that is available to staff and updated as changes to the system occur.</p>

<p>Programs with multiple offices have one intake system that is the point of entry for
all applicants. </p>
<b>

<p>(b) Staffing </p>

<p>While staffing may vary as to professional background and employment status, all staff
on the telephone intake and delivery system will be well trained, experienced and closely
supervised </p>
</b>

<p>The staffing structure recognizes the importance of intake as a key to successful
delivery of services. For example, it relies on staff who has experience and expertise in
the area of intake. </p>

<p>Staffing levels are adequate to serve client communities without routinely relying on
callbacks.</p>

<p>The intake system is integrated with the provider&#146;s other units or components.</p>

<p>A free-standing intake system provider is integrated into the overall delivery system
of the service area. </p>

<p>The staff is knowledgeable in substantive areas affecting clients and in intake
delivery procedures as appropriate for the size of the legal services provider.</p>

<p>The staff employ resource materials or manuals to support their work.</p>

<p>The staff have access to information about non-legal services that may be of assistance
to the applicant. The staff is knowledgeable about these services and refers applicants
when appropriate. </p>

<p>The staff is knowledgeable about intake policies of other legal services providers to
whom the applicant may be referred. </p>

<p>The staff schedule is reasonably adjusted to avoid burnout caused by excessive hours on
intake.</p>

<p>The staff receives regular training on issues of substantive law and intake skills. </p>

<p>The staff consists of generalists or specialists who have cross training in one or more
other legal areas. </p>

<p>There are specific, written protocols describing the operation of the intake system
that are available to staff and updated as changes to the system occur.</p>

<p>The staff engages in regular internal communication and scheduled meetings of intake
workers to discuss emergent or common legal issues and system operations. </p>
<b>

<p>(c) Decision on Assistance</p>

<p>Applicants for service will receive prompt determination as to the type of services
that they will receive from the program </p>
</b>

<p>The legal services provider&#146;s written case acceptance policy provides guidelines
regarding: eligibility, conflicts, cases to be accepted, services to be provided, and
cases appropriate for referral.</p>

<p>A decision is made promptly as to whether, and what type of, assistance will be
provided. The applicant is promptly informed of the decision.</p>

<p>Denials based on case type (not falling within priorities, restrictions) will be
referred to other service providers, where available.</p>

<p>Denials based on lack of legal merit (statutes of limitations, facts) require no
further action other than supervisory review.</p>

<p>For a case where the decision by the intake worker is that advice or brief service is
the appropriate assistance, that assistance is promptly provided, and is summarized in a
letter or e-mail to the client. Assistance is often supplemented with legal information,
forms, community service information, and web site information<i>.</p>
</i>

<p>Cases requiring extended assistance are promptly referred to the extended assistance
unit for review or the applicant is given an appointment. The referring intake staff will
notify the applicant of the referral action in writing.</p>

<p>Cases originating from a free-standing intake program requiring extended assistance are
promptly referred to an appropriate provider for extended service. The referring intake
staff will notify the applicant of the referral action in writing.</p>

<p>When preliminary advice is given pending a decision on extended assistance, the staff
giving the advice will advise the applicant that the action of giving preliminary advice
does not mean that the case will be accepted for extended assistance.</p>

<p>Within two business days of the referral, the extended assistance unit or program
receiving the referral will contact the applicant. Within five business days of the
referral, a decision will be made concerning acceptance of the case, and the applicant
will be promptly notified. </p>
<b>

<p>(d) Intake Technology </p>

<p>The program should use technology that will expedite the applicant&#146;s journey from
initial application to appropriate advice, brief service or referral.</p>

<p>Phone System</p>
</b>

<p>The program provides a toll free number (either local or 800 number) for the applicant
to call to get into the intake system.</p>

<p>The initial intake options are provided by the telephone system. Options may include a
language choice, recorded substantive information or the types of services provided by the
program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The instructions are multi-lingual in locations that require it. </p>
  <p>The telephone system provides information on the program, intake procedure, and basic
  legal problem areas.</p>
  <p>It provides methods for an applicant to reach a live attendant if needed. </p>
  <p>It is capable of routing calls to multiple intake locations if required by the intake
  system. </p>
  <p>It can advise an applicant on the expected hold time and give an option to leave
  callback information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the initial intake worker transfers the applicant to a casehandler, the system will
have the ability to route the call to the casehandler without the applicant having to call
back or call a different number. </p>

<p>The system is either designed so that the intake worker can see who is available for
calls and route the applicant to that person, or the system does it automatically after
the intake worker puts the applicant into the queue. </p>

<p>The system is designed to accommodate persons with disabilities.</p>
<b>

<p>Case management Software</p>
</b>

<p>The legal services provider has a central database covering the entire intake area to
allow information sharing and system-wide conflicts checking.</p>

<p>The software allows for regular backups of the database to ensure preservation of data.</p>

<p>There is eligibility checking with built-in error checking to insure CSR accuracy.</p>

<p>The software provides intake workers with a system of questions and advice for
applicants keyed to legal problems. </p>

<p>It provides intake workers with searchable referral information on other agencies and
service providers to provide applicants with additional help.</p>

<p>It stores sufficient information to prepare needed reports for management and funders.</p>

<p>It provides intake workers with the ability to generate customized form letters for
applicants, clients and others, such as PBI attorneys or other agencies.</p>
<b>

<p>(e) Quality Control</p>

<p>The quality control system ensures that the service provided to clients is accurate,
informative, prompt, professional and conflict-free.</p>
</b>

<p>There is a designated supervisor of the intake systems who is an experienced attorney.</p>

<p>Within 24 hours of the initial contact, there is a review of intake decisions and
assistance. </p>

<p>The review process is designed to screen for quality and to identify recurrent problems
or issues in the client community.</p>

<p>Intake staff receives ongoing substantive and procedural training on performing intake.</p>

<p>Attention is given to the effectiveness of the intake system and results achieved for
applicants and clients. For example, this can be done by using satisfaction surveys and,
when appropriate, outcome measures.</p>

<p>Resource materials used by casehandlers are regularly reviewed and updated.</p>

<p>Based on ongoing evaluation, appropriate procedural changes are made in the intake
system.</p>

<p>Legal services providers are aware of technological advances that benefit their intake
systems as they become available and use those technologies to enhance the services they
provide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="left"><img src="../images/brownline.gif" width="640" height="5"></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Free-standing programs are generally those whose primary goals and
activities are to provide intake and brief service assistance and to refer most clients
needing more extended assistance to other legal providers. Extended service programs are
usually those that provide extended service in addition to advice, brief service and
referral. These programs may receive most of the intake from free-standing programs or may
have a unit that conducts intake and is integrated fully into the program.</p>

<p align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 12, 1998, the Legal
Services Corporation issued Program Letter 98-1 calling upon all
LSC recipients to participate in a state planning process to
examine, from a statewide perspective,<i> </i>what steps should
be taken in their states to further develop a comprehensive,
integrated statewide delivery system. The Letter poses seven
questions recipients are to address and requests recipients
submit a report to LSC on or before October 1, 1998. These<i>
&quot;State Planning Considerations&quot;</i> provide more
information about statewide goals, capacities and approaches
recipients should consider in addressing these questions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In presenting these<i> Planning
Considerations</i>, LSC does not intend to establish &quot;bottom
line standards.&quot; Each state is different and needs to find
its own ways to strengthen and further develop its statewide
system. At the same time, we believe there are enough
commonalities among the states and experience within the legal
services community to suggest some guideposts that may help
recipients and other stakeholders in their collaborative efforts
to improve and expand services to clients.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Goals of Effective Statewide Systems</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<i> State Planning
Considerations</i> begin with an overview of key statewide
delivery goals. Central to each is the notion that effective
delivery systems are responsive to the most compelling needs of
eligible clients, ensure the highest and most strategic use of
all available resources, and maximize the opportunity for <i>clients</i>
<i>throughout the state</i> to receive timely, effective and
appropriate legal services. Local input and investment are
important to assure providers respond to local needs, develop
local solutions where appropriate, and build support within their
communities. At the same time, it is the responsibility of all
legal services providers to strive together to assure no eligible
client is left out of the justice system or receives less
effective assistance because of geography or other factors.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Capacities</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Considerations</i> next
discuss the capacities and coordinated efforts recipients were
asked to address by Program Letter 98-1. Funding limitations
compel legal services providers continually to make choices among
very important legal needs and possible service delivery
activities, and to constantly face tradeoffs in which an
increased commitment in one area may mean a lessening of emphasis
in another. Accordingly, the Corporation does not expect that all
states can develop every capacity<i> </i>in the immediate future
or undertake every coordinated activity at the same time or to
the same degree, especially where doing so may require
acquisition or reallocation of significant and scarce resources.
States must seek a reasonable balance among the areas, in light
of their resources, and LSC will take into account variations in
resources available to states as well as the priorities states
may choose for strengthening their delivery system.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Indicators</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further assist recipients,
these <i>Considerations</i> also present &quot;indicators&quot;
for each of the seven topics to be addressed in the state
planning process. The indicators provide examples of approaches
in place or under development in many states to which state
planners can look for an indication of their state's progress in
each of the seven areas. <b><i>The indicators should not be seen
as requirements or as the only approaches possible or desirable
in a given state. </i></b>There may be a variety of other
activities which a statewide system of legal services providers
may choose to undertake on a statewide basis in a particular
state, and the Corporation encourages states to do so.</p>

<p align="center"><b>System Configuration</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, these <i>Planning
Considerations </i>present a framework and indicators for
planners to consider as they analyze whether the present
configuration of programs currently achieves, and <i>will in the
future</i>, achieve the best possible results for clients. The
Corporation remains committed to development of integrated
delivery systems in each state and encourages recipients to
consider carefully whether the present design and configuration
of programs facilitates development of an integrated system that
reflects the goals and capacities presented in these<i> Planning
Considerations.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>GOALS OF EFFECTIVE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation encourages
development of statewide civil legal services delivery systems
which are responsive to the most compelling needs of eligible
clients, ensure the highest and most strategic use of all
available resources, and maximize the opportunity for clients
throughout the state to receive timely, effective and appropriate
legal services. In accordance with prevailing professional norms,
such a system should:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>identify and address the most important legal needs
            of eligible clients, as determined by appropriate
            needs assessments, taking into account the diversity
            of persons and needs in the state and its various
            communities;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>strive to provide low-income persons throughout the
            state broad and equal access to legal services
            regardless of such obstacles as disability,
            geographical isolation, culture and language;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>provide high quality legal services to clients
            throughout the state, regardless of regional
            distinctions in demography, the economy, or the
            presence or absence of other local resources to
            provide or support the provision of legal services to
            low-income persons; </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>encourage innovation in the delivery of legal
            services accompanied by appropriate assessment of
            results;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>minimize duplication of capacities and administration
            and make the best use of resources available to the
            delivery system as a whole and its component parts;
            and</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>have the capacity and flexibility to respond
            effectively and efficiently to new and emerging
            client needs and other changes affecting the delivery
            of legal services to the poor.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>CAPACITIES AND COORDINATED ACTIVITIES</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State planning should be a
continuous, forward-looking process. There is no national
template that can be applied, and no optimum design or
configuration applicable to all states. At the same time, there
are key functional capacities and coordinated efforts that, when
present, and integrated into a statewide system, have been shown
to enhance the effective delivery of legal services to low-income
people throughout the state. Program Letter 98-1 identified the
following:</p>

<p align="center"><b>I.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>A DELIVERY NETWORK THAT MAXIMIZES CLIENT
ACCESS, EFFICIENT DELIVERY, AND HIGH QUALITY LEGAL ASSISTANCE</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within each state, all
low-income persons should have equal access to legal services. To
achieve this goal, systems must be designed to use scarce
resources efficiently and to overcome barriers to access caused
by geographic isolation, language, disability, age, and
inaccessibility or location of the legal services office.
Programs must also tailor their services to ensure meaningful
access to clients with distinct needs, such as the homeless,
elderly, institutionalized, immigrants, farmworkers, and Native
Americans. Once potential clients seek services from legal
services providers, the state delivery network should have the
capacity to respond promptly, efficiently, and effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, most civil legal
services programs required that all persons seeking assistance
have an in-office interview to determine eligibility and the
extent of services to be received, even though most of these
persons only needed or would only receive, information, advice,
or very brief service. Such approaches have proven to be
inefficient and, at times, a barrier to access itself. Many legal
services programs have replaced these historic walk-in methods
with telephone intake and delivery systems which provide high
quality advice and brief service, and promptly refer clients
whose problems require more assistance to program case handlers
or other resources. These telephone delivery systems permit
clients to obtain help without traveling to an office, extend
service to persons who previously would not have received any
help, and free casehandlers to spend more time on extended
service cases. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a number of states,
statewide or regional systems, using advanced telephone and
computer technology, have consolidated some or all of these
intake, advice and referral functions in one location where
trained, experienced staff provide prompt access for and
assistance to clients. Some of these systems have a single or
primary point of entry which lessens confusion among clients
about where to seek assistance while allowing coordination of
services, avoiding duplication, and conserving resources among
providers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In states or regions where
state planners believe a single intake, advice and referral
system may not be appropriate, providers should find other ways
to link their intake and delivery systems to provide prompt and
even access for low-income persons throughout the state. At a
minimum, all providers must have efficient, responsive systems
and coordinate on such matters as publicity, case acceptance,
intake and referral policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, while legal services
offices within the state may have special programs to deal with
the legal needs of special client populations such as immigrants,
farmworkers and Native Americans, offices without these special
programs must coordinate how the legal needs of these persons and
others who experience disproportionate access barriers will be
met.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Indicators</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In assessing the strengths
and weaknesses of the state's delivery network, as well as to
develop strategies to maximize client access, efficient delivery
and high quality legal assistance, state planners may wish to
consider whether:</i></p>

<p><b>Intake, Advice and Referral Systems Are Coordinated and
Skilled Personnel Provide Prompt, Responsive, Intake, Advice, and
Referral.</b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Intake, advice and referral systems are centralized or
        coordinated within appropriate geographical regions to
        provide easy and even access to eligible clients.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Intake, advice and referral system cases are regularly
        reviewed for quality of analysis and advice and
        identification of recurring or systemic problems
        affecting clients.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Intake, advice and referral systems effectively use
        technology to record and manage client data and generate
        letters, information and self-help materials for clients.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Programs routinely evaluate intake, advice and referral
        system effectiveness, including how effectively the
        system provides access to eligible clients.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Programs Have Taken Collective Action To Overcome Barriers
to Client Access to Legal Services.</b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Programs use a variety of means, such as toll free
        telephone lines, outreach visits, coordination with other
        agencies, and utilization of private attorneys to make
        services available to clients living in locations distant
        from a staffed office.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Intake, advice and referral are conducted in languages
        commonly spoken in the area served.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>All programs with telephone intake systems offer
        alternatives to those clients who have difficulties in
        gaining access to or using a telephone system.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Special Population Clients Are Able to Gain Access to Legal
Services Throughout the State.</b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Intake, advice and referral systems identify and address
        legal issues of special population clients.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Intake, advice and referral staff are knowledgeable about
        specialized legal expertise available within the state so
        that proper referrals may be made.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Service delivery to special population clients is
        coordinated among programs.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><b>II.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>COORDINATED EFFORTS AND A CAPACITY TO
UTILIZE NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TO ASSURE COMPATIBILITY,
PROMOTE EFFICIENCY, IMPROVE QUALITY AND EXPAND SERVICES TO
CLIENTS</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective use of technology can
significantly increase low-income persons' access to assistance,
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of legal work within
programs, and enhance coordination among legal services providers
and related organizations and individuals. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology can expand the
access of low-income persons to legal assistance by increasing
the amount of advice and brief service, community legal education
materials and pro se assistance available. Intake, advice and
referral systems that take advantage of technology to provide
prompt advice, referrals and brief service hold the promise of
serving more persons more quickly with the same or similar
resources devoted to traditional intake structures. Web sites,
intranets and related technologies can make community legal
education and pro se materials much more broadly available than
they have been. While the access of low-income persons to the Web
is currently limited, libraries, schools and providers of other
social services are rapidly obtaining this capacity, providing
public access to citizens and alerting low-income persons to
pertinent information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The efficiency and
effectiveness of legal work within a program may be improved by
augmenting casehandlers' access to legal information and
expertise, strengthening legal work management, and increasing
communication and coordination within a program. Computers linked
to the Internet increase access to legal information and
expertise by allowing access to computerized statutory and case
materials, legal research materials, brief and pleadings banks
and by linking casehandlers and task forces through e-mail and
similar connectivity. Supervision of legal work and overall
coordination of program advocacy are made considerably easier by
the presence of networked case management software and e-mail
access to all casehandlers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the capacity of a
legal services programs to be in touch with other legal services
professionals, professionals in related fields, community
organizations, and private bar members potentially or currently
working on pro bono projects is considerably enhanced by e-mail,
Web access and other related technologies. This capacity can
result in shared information and expertise and expanded
opportunities for coordinated efforts and joint projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This potential has the best
chance of being realized if all legal services providers within
the state work together to expand resources and secure necessary
expertise to establish compatible systems that are coordinated
and non-duplicative.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Indicators</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In assessing the strengths
and weaknesses of the state's technological capacities as well as
in developing strategies to improve or expand technological
capacities, state planners may wish to consider whether:</i></p>

<p><b>Advocates and Programs Have the Necessary Technological
Capacity.</b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>There is a statewide planning capacity to assure the
        coordination of technology efforts throughout the
        delivery system and to plan for improvements. Plans are
        updated periodically to keep pace with changing
        technologies and delivery system needs.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Each case handler has a desktop computer and the
        necessary skills and ability to use it effectively.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>In offices with more than five persons, computers are
        networked. </li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Each office has at least one computer accessible to all
        staff with e-mail and Internet connectivity. Where each
        staff member does not currently have e-mail access at his
        or her desk, this capacity is being planned for within
        the next two years. </li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>The same case management software is used throughout the
        state. The software supports case reporting, intake and
        timekeeping.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>The delivery system has in place systems of technology
        training and support adequate to its needs.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>There is a plan, including a plan to develop and allocate
        resources, for necessary periodic replacement or
        upgrading of hardware and software.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Materials Are Put on the Web for Use by Low-Income Persons
and Social Services Providers.</b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Community legal education and pro se materials are
        available on one or more Web sites in the state. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Programs' Technological Infrastructure Supports Telephone
Intake and Brief Advice Systems. </b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Telephone intake and advice systems take advantage of
        appropriate technology including case management and
        advanced telephone systems.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Programs' technological infrastructure (networked
        computers) is sufficient to support regional or statewide

<p><b>Casehandlers Have Electronic Access to Legal Information
and Expertise. </b></p>

<ul type="square">
    <li>A computerized brief and pleading bank and other

</ul>

<p align="center"><b>III.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>COORDINATED EFFORT TO EXPAND CLIENT ACCESS
TO THE COURTS, ENHANCE SELF-HELP OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW-INCOME
PERSONS, AND</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>PROVIDE PREVENTIVE LEGAL EDUCATION AND
ADVICE</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equal access to justice has
long been a cornerstone of the Legal Services Corporation Act and
a critical part of the mission of legal services programs.
Reductions in federal funds coupled with the increase in client
needs have required the legal services community to develop or
use new approaches in order to address the need of low-income
persons for access to information, services, courts, and other
dispute resolution forums and processes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several states have developed
successful pro se and access-to-courts projects. Because of the
influence of state laws and rules affecting such initiatives,
individual providers, working alone, often have to make intensive
efforts to implement such strategies. In many instances, positive
results can be realized more easily by coordinated state level
efforts. Collaboration with state bar committees and state
judicial administrators can result in rule changes, development
of uniform practices and procedures, publication and
dissemination of pro se oriented materials and the development of
a more accessible court system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coordinated state level efforts
to develop self-help and community education materials can
provide similar benefit to clients. In some states, legal
services programs, state bar associations and others have
collaborated to develop, maintain, and distribute (in some
instances, electronically) a range of legal information useful to
low-income persons. These efforts are a cost effective way to
provide information that can help low-income persons avoid or
resolve legal problems by themselves.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Indicators</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In assessing the strengths
and weaknesses of the state's access-to-justice capacity as well

</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Where appropriate, audio, audio-visual, and electronic
        community legal education (CLE) materials are developed

<p align="center"><b>COORDINATION OF LEGAL WORK AND A CAPACITY TO
PROVIDE TRAINING, INFORMATION AND EXPERT ASSISTANCE NECESSARY FOR
THE DELIVERY OF HIGH QUALITY ASSISTANCE</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provision of high quality legal
services requires a competent and knowledgeable staff. This, in
turn, requires on-going training and professional development,
resource materials, timely updates about legal developments and
strategies, and co-counseling or other expert assistance on
complex client matters. Most programs individually lack the
resources and capacities to ensure their staff are provided
necessary training, information and related professional
assistance. Further, it is not efficient or effective for each
program in a state to separately attempt to address the needs of
their staffs in these areas. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clients are better served and
all programs in a state are more effective, economical and
efficient, if the staff expertise and other resources of all
providers are strategically coordinated to meet the training and
professional development needs of staff throughout the state.
Effective coordination allows for the identification and use of
all available resources, minimizes duplication, facilitates
appropriate division of labor, and assures more efficient use of
scarce resources.</p>

<p align="center"><b>COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WITH, AND A
HIGH DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT BY THE PRIVATE BAR</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private attorney involvement is
a critical element of any integrated and coordinated legal
services delivery system that is committed to ensuring the
highest and best use of all available resources. Many states,
employing a variety of techniques, have been successful in
enlisting the state Bar, the judiciary and others in developing
and supporting private attorney involvement throughout the state.
Coordinated recruitment, training and recognition of pro bono
attorneys have also increased participation and helped local
programs expand the range and types of services available to
clients. Cooperative efforts among providers can also result in
engagement of pro bono attorneys across program boundaries and
otherwise help overcome the difficulties rural programs may
encounter in recruiting attorneys where there may be relatively
few practicing lawyers in the area.</p>

        private attorneys, to increase the availability of
        private bar assistance.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Private attorneys are offered the opportunity to
        participate in a full spectrum of legal work, including
        advice and brief service, administrative representation,
        transactional assistance, and litigation; and are offered
        a range of activities beyond taking cases, such as
        conducting community education and pro se classes,
        volunteering on a hotline, training, co-counseling and
        mentoring staff.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Private attorneys with specialized expertise or skills
        are recruited to co-counsel or act as a resource (across
        program boundaries) on specialized substantive issues
        and/or issues which<i> </i>may generally not be the
        province of legal services lawyers, e. g., zoning, tax,

<p align="center"><b>DIVERSIFIED FUNDING AND COORDINATION OF
RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past twenty years,
legal services programs have developed strong relationships with
local bar associations, individual attorneys, governmental
entities, and funders to help generate resources to expand the
delivery of civil legal services to the poor. While local
fundraising efforts continue to be an important revenue source
for programs, coordinated, statewide fundraising efforts offer
the opportunity to raise significant, additional funds and often
are a critical source of revenue for programs in areas without
the economic base to support local fundraising campaigns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many states recipients have
succeeded, through collective efforts of programs and
stakeholders, to develop and expand revenues for all programs
through state appropriations, filing fee surcharges, state
fundraising campaigns, state bar dues checkoffs, increased
attorney registration fees, direct state bar grants, and support
for statewide projects from foundations and corporations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pending challenge to IOLTA
funding makes it even more important that recipients evaluate the
possibilities for further resource development and
diversification and develop a statewide strategy to preserve,
build, and create new financial and non-financial resources in
their states.</p>

        appropriations, filing fee surcharges, state fundraising
        campaigns, state bar dues checkoffs, increased attorney
        registration fees, direct state bar grants, and support
        for statewide projects from foundations and corporations.</li>

<p align="center"><b>A CONFIGURATION THAT MAXIMIZES THE EFFECTIVE
AND ECONOMICAL DELIVERY OF HIGH QUALITY LEGAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT
THE STATE</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No single delivery structure or
configuration fits all states. Each state has its own demography,
geography, resources and history, and state planners must take
into account these and other factors when determining what
configuration maximizes services for clients. However, in
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current system
configuration, it is critical that state planners focus on the
future rather than the past. History and prior decisions by LSC
and others are not of themselves sufficient to justify the status
quo. Given the significant changes in the legal services
landscape, state planners must take a fresh look, <i>from a
statewide perspective,</i> and ask if the present configuration
currently achieves, <i>and will in the future</i>, achieve the
best possible results for clients.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some states it may be
possible to develop and implement statewide initiatives to
improve service delivery, increase resources and enhance the
capacity of the system to meet the civil legal needs of
low-income people throughout the state without altering service
areas or historical relationships. In other states,
implementation of such initiatives requires reconfiguration of
organizational relationships and service areas. An effective
state planning process will carefully assess whether the present
and future needs of clients will best be served by the current
configuration or whether changes are required to achieve an
integrated system that reflects the goals and capacities
presented in these <i>State Planning Considerations</i>.</p>

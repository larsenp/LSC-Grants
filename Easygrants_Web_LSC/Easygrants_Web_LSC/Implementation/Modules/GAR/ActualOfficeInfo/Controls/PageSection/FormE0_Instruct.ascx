    <td><p><strong>Forms E-0 &amp; E-1 &mdash; Actual Office and Staffing Information</strong></p>
      <p> This section contains instructions on updating actual office and staffing information. All recipients of 2015 LSC funding must complete these forms. <strong>Please report only staff that are engaged in or provide support for the provision of civil legal services. Staff only engaged in other functions, for example criminal defense (except as allowed in Native American Tribal courts) or social service activities, should not be reported. </strong> </p>

      <p>Form E-0 lists all offices for which staffing data were provided in the 2014 GARs. It includes the office locations, contact information, and other related information. Any changes made to this information during 2015 should be reported on this form. Information about offices the program opened or closed in calendar year 2015 should also be entered on the Form E-0.</p>
      <p>Program staffing information is provided on the E-1 Forms. This is organized by office: Main Office, Form E-1(a); Branch Office(s), Form(s) E-1(b); and Subrecipient Office(s) Form(s) E-1(c). Provide the specified staffing information for every office that was open in 2015. Also, provide the necessary information for any offices that were closed or opened in 2015. </p>

      <p>Programs that submitted office and staffing information last year will find these forms pre-filled with last year's information and need only to update that information. Programs that did not submit office and staffing information last year must enter a complete set of staffing and office information. Programs that merged in the prior year will find all the surviving program's offices and staffing information pre-filled and we will also, where possible, pre-fill the non-surviving program(s)’ offices and their staff, renumbering the offices with numbers larger than the highest number used by the surviving program and redesignating their former main office as a branch.</p>
      
<p> <strong>Form E-0: Actual Office Information</strong></p>
      <p> Form E-0 lists all offices for which staffing data were provided in the 2014 GARs. It includes information about address, telephone number, fax number, person in charge, and related information. Use this form to update information that changed any office in 2015 and to provide information about any offices your program opened or closed in 2015.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide <strong>updated</strong> information for offices that were open throughout 2015, click the “Edit” option for that office and enter the appropriate information.</li>
        <li>For any office(s) your program <strong>closed</strong> in 2015, click the “Edit” option for that office. In the “date closed” field enter the date on which the office(s) was (were) closed. Do not enter a closing date for any office that will not be closed until 2016 as you will report such offices in next year’s E-0. </li>
        <li>For employees in closed offices, you are required either (a) to enter a termination date on the E-1(a); or (b) to transfer that employee or employees to an existing (or new) office. Information on any non-terminated employees who remain in a closed office will not be accepted, and you will receive an error message to that effect if you try to submit. </li>
        <li>If your program opened any new offices in 2015, click “Add Branch Office” or “Add Recipient Office,” as appropriate, and provide the requested information. An entry for “date opened” is required. This date must be within calendar year 2015. If the "date opened" information is not entered, the form will not be accepted and you will receive an error message when trying to submit. The system automatically provides “Office #” for the new office you are entering. Make sure to save before exiting. Then enter information about the office on the E-1 created for that office.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p><strong><i>Additional guidance:</i></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save the information before exiting the screen.</li>
        <li>For telephone and fax numbers, use (xxx) xxx-xxxx format. </li>
        <li>The Regular Full-Time Work Week (Number of Hours) in Form E-0 will usually be 40, but if your normal work week is less than 40 hours, you can enter your actual normal work week. The normal work week CANNOT be more than 40 hours, even if most of your staff are FLSA Exempt employees who do work more than 40 hours. This Regular Full-Time work week is the number of hours your hourly (non-exempt) staff are expected to work to earn a full paycheck. If you have two different full-time work weeks for a single office (e.g. Attorneys 40 hours, support staff 37.5 hours) as a few programs do, record the smaller number as your full-time work week for that office, so all full-time staff will show at 100% full-time. </li>
      </ul>
   <p>Only one office may be reported at the same address, even if multiple functions are carried out from that one address.</p>

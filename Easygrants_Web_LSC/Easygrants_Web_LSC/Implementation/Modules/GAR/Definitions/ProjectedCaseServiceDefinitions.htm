<p><strong> Interim Case Service Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Client Services include all forms of advice, brief service and extended service to low-income clients in cases involving all types of legal problems. </p>
<p>Limited Service includes counsel &amp; advice and limited action. </p>
<p>Extended Service includes negotiation toward settlement (with or without litigation), administrative agency proceedings, litigation in court and other Extensive Services beyond advice and limited service, including transactional services which do not involve a controversy, and thus are not "settled" or litigated.
